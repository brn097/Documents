                 <lb/>drop off, with as much husk or skins

                 <lb/>to keep them, as much is possible, 
                 <lb/>from any dashing of Sea-water in the 
                 <lb/>Voyage. 5. To set Plants or young 
                 <lb/>Trees in halfe Tubs of Earth, arched 
                 <lb/>over with hoops, and cover'd with

             <p>At present I shall informe you, 
             <lb/>that the Water about our <name type="place" ref="108">Island</name> 
             <lb/>does not flow, by any Mans Ob<lb break="no"/>

                 at other times not above 
             <lb/><hi rend="italic">three</hi> Foot. It is <hi rend="italic">High-water</hi>,
             <lb/>when the Moon is about an hour 
             <lb/>high; and the like after her go<lb break="no"/>ing down. It flowes in from the

                 <lb/>East</hi> nearest, and in that part of 
             <lb/>the Land, which lies most to the 
             <lb/><hi rend="italic">North-West</hi>, there it is High-wa<lb break="no"/>ter 
                 soonest. But the Tyde does not always ebb and flow di<lb break="no"/>rectly 
                 that course round about our Coast; but, I suppose, the rea<lb break="no"/>son 
                 is, that some points of Land, or Sholes, may turn its <hi rend="italic">North-<lb/>West</hi> 
                 and <hi rend="italic">South-East</hi> course.
             </p>
                        
             <p>We have herabout very many sorts of <hi rend="italic">Fishes</hi>. There is a<lb break="no"/>
             mongst them great store of <hi rend="italic">Whales</hi>, which in <hi rend="italic">March, April</hi> and 
             <lb/><hi rend="italic">May</hi> use our Coast. I have my self killed many of them. 
             <lb/>Their Females have abundance of Milk, which their young 
             <lb/>ones suck out of the Teats, that grow by their Navell. They 
             <lb/>have no Teeth, but feed on Mosse, growing on the Rocks at the 
             <lb/>bottom during these three Moneths, and at no other season of 
             <lb/>the Year. When that is consumed and gone, the Whales go 
             <lb/>away also. These we kill for their Oyl. But here have been 
             <lb/><hi rend="italic">Sperma-Ceti-Whales</hi> driven upon the shore, which <hi rend="italic">Sperma</hi> (as 
                 
        <pb n="794"/>
                 
           <fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(794)</fw>
                 
             <lb/>they call it) lies all over the Body of those Whales. These 
             <lb/>have divers Teeth, which may be about as big as a Mans wrist; 
             <lb/>and I hope by the next opportunity to send you one of them. 
             <lb/>I have been at the <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="295">Bahama</name></hi>-Islands, and there have been found 
             <lb/>of this same sort of Whales dead on the Shore, with <hi rend="italic">Sperma</hi> 
             <lb/>all over their Bodies. My self with about 20 more have agreed 
             <lb/>to try, whether we can master and kill them, for I could never 
             <lb/>hear of any of that sort, that were kill'd by any man; such is 
             <lb/>their fierceness and swiftness. One such Whale would be worth 
             <lb/>many hundred pounds. They are very strong, and inlay'd with 
             <lb/>sinews all over their Body, which may be drawn out thirty fathom 
             <lb/>long. 
             </p>
  
             <p>There is an Island among the <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="295">Bahama</name></hi>'s, which some of our 
             <lb/>People are setled upon, and more are going thither. 'Tis cal<lb break="no"/>
             led <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">New-Providence</name></hi>; where many rare things might be disco<lb break="no"/>ver'd, 
                 if the People were but encouraged: And I am of opini<lb break="no"/>on, 
                 there is not a more healthful place in the World. 'Tis sto<lb break="no"/>red 
                 with variety of Fish and Fowl, and with divers sorts of Trees 
             <lb/>and other Plants, whose qualities are not yet known. 
             </p>
             <p>As to the <hi rend="italic">Age</hi> of our Inhabitants here, some do live to an 
             <lb/>hundred years and something upwards; many live till they are 
             <lb/>nigh a hundred, but few above: And when they dye, 'tis age and 
             <lb/>weakness, that is the cause, and not any disease that attends 
             <lb/>them. The general distemper that is yearly amongst us, is a 
             <lb/><hi rend="italic">Cold</hi>; and that is most gotten in the hottest weather. The 
             <lb/>Air here is very sweet and pleasant. Our Diet is but ordinary, 
             <lb/>and the People generally poor; and I observe, that poor Peo<lb break="no"/>
             ple are most healthful.

                          <lb/>is now in this City. There were two <hi rend="italic">Parhelia's</hi>, one on each 
                          <lb/>side of the true Sun, and they were so resplendent, that the na<lb break="no"/>

                          <lb/>projecting very long rays from it self. They were both on that

             <p><choice><orig>SIr</orig><reg>Sir</reg></choice>, having been lately in the Copper, Silver, and Gold-mines
             <lb/>in <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="165">Hungary</name></hi>, I hope ere long to give you a particular account 
             <lb/>thereof; presenting this in the mean time concerning <hi rend="italic">Damps</hi> in 
             <lb/>these Mines; whereof I understand, that they happen in most
             <lb/>of them, that are deep; and that they happen not only in the 
             <lb/><hi rend="italic">Cuniculi</hi> or direct passages, where they walk on Horizontally 
             <lb/>(by these Mine-men call'd <hi rend="italic">Stollen</hi>) but also in the <hi rend="italic">Putei</hi> or Per<lb break="no"/>
             pendicular Cutts or Descents (term'd <hi rend="italic">Schachts</hi> by the same.) 
             <lb/>They are met with not only in places, where the Earth is full 
             <lb/>of Clay or the like substances, but also where it is Rocky: and 
             <lb/>one place they shew'd me in the Copper-mine at <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Hern-groundt</name></hi>, 
             <lb/>where there has been a very pernicious damp, and yet the Rock 
             <lb/>so hard, that it could not be broken by their Instruments; but 
             <lb/>the descent was all made by the means of Gun-powder, ram'd 
             <lb/>into long round holes in the Rock, and so blowne up. Ano<lb break="no"/>
             ther place they show'd me, where there is sometimes a damp, 
                 <lb/>and sometimes clear weather. When there is much water in<pb n="966"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(966)</fw>
             <lb/>the Mine, so as to stop up the lower part of this passage, then 
             <lb/>the damp becomes discoverable, and commonly strong. I 
             <lb/>procured one to enter it, till his Lamp went out 4. or 5. times, 
             <lb/>in the same manner as at <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Grotto del Cane</name></hi> in <name type="place" ref="71">Italy</name>.
                        </p>

             <p>Damps are not all of the same force, but some weaker, some 
             <lb/>stronger; some suffocate in a small space of time, others only 
             <lb/>render the Workemen faint, with no further hurt, except 
             <lb/>they continue long in the place. The Miners (who think them<lb break="no"/>
             selves no Workmen, if they be not able to cure a Damp, or 
             <lb/>to cure the bad Weather, or make the Weather, as they term 
             <lb/>it) performe it by perflation, by letting the Aire in and out, 
             <lb/>and causing, as 'twere, a Circulation of it. In the Mine at 
             <lb/><hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Herrn-groundt</name></hi> they did cure a bad Damp by a great paire of 
             <lb/>Bellows, which were blown continually for many days. The 
             <lb/>ordinary remedy is by long Tubes, through which the Air 
             <lb/>continually passing, they are able to digg streight on for a long 
             <lb/>way without impediment in breathing. For some <hi rend="italic">Cuniculi</hi> are 
             <lb/>500. fathoms long; which will not seeme strange to any one that 
             <lb/>shall see the Mapp of the Copper-mine at <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Herrn-groundt</name></hi> or the 
             <lb/>Gold-mine at <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Chrennitz</name></hi>. And in the Silver-Trinity-mine by 
             <lb/><hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Schemnitz</name></hi>, I pass'd quite under a great Hill, and came out on 
             <lb/>the other side. At <name type="place"><hi rend="italic">Windschach</hi>-mine</name> by <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Schemnitz</name></hi> they show'd 
             <lb/>me the place, where 5. men and a Gentleman of quality were 
             <lb/>lost; for which reason they have now plac'd a Tube there. The 
             <lb/>like they place over all doores, and over all ways, where they 
             <lb/>digg right on for a great space, and have no passage through. At 
             <lb/><hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Chremnitz</name></hi> they told me, that 28. men had been killed at one 
             <lb/>time in 4. <hi rend="italic">Cuniculi</hi>, 7. in each; and in the sinking of <hi rend="italic">Leopold's</hi>-
             <lb/>pitt, which is 150. fathoms deep, they were much troubled 
             <lb/>with damps, which they remedied in this manner.
             </p>

             <p>They fixed a Tube to the side of the <hi rend="italic">Schacht</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pitt</hi>, from 
             <lb/>the top to the bottom, and that not proving sufficient, they 
             <lb/>forc'd down a broad flat board, which cover'd or stopp'd the 
             <lb/>Pitt, or couched very near the sides of it, on all sides but where 
             <lb/>the Tube was; and so forc'd out all the Air in the pitt through
             <lb/>the Tube: which work they were forc'd often to repeat. And 
             <lb/>now they having divers other passages into it, the Air is good 
             <lb/>and sufficient; and I was drawn up through it without the least 
                 <lb/>trouble in breathing.<pb n="967"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(967)</fw>

             <lb/>they sometimes perish by other ways. For their being in these

             <lb/>where 'tis Rocky, men are sometimes destroy'd by the wood set 
             <lb/>on fire. And in the Gold-mine at <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Chremnitz</name></hi> the wood was once 
             <lb/>set on fire by the carelesness of a boy, and 50 Miners smothe<lb break="no"/>

               <lb/><hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Friuli</name></hi>, is feared low, and encompass'd with Hills on all 
               <lb/>sides. A River of the same name runs by it, which although 
               <lb/><name type="person"><hi rend="italic">Leandro</hi></name> terms it <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">superbissimo siume d'Idria</foreign>, yet I found small

               ful Raine it proves sufficient to convey down the Firr-Trees 
               <lb/>and other Wood required in the building of the Mines, and also 
               <lb/>for Fuel required in the service of them: And to this end there 
               <lb/>is an handsome work of Piles made sloaping athwart the River 
               <lb/>(after the same manner as I observ'd in <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Newsol</name></hi> in upper <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="165">Hun<lb break="no"/>

               <lb/>down, and cast into the River above this place.
                          </p>
 
               <p>What is chiefly considerable in this Town, are the <hi rend="italic">Quick-
               <lb/>silver</hi>-Mines, very well known to the Neighbouring parts, and 
               <lb/>exceeding useful to many at greater distance.
                          </p>        

               <p>The entrance into these Mines is not high, or upon an Hill, as 
               <lb/>in many other Mines; but in town it self, whereby they are 
               <lb/>somewhat the more troubled with Water, against which they are 
               <lb/>provided with many excellent Engins and Devices, as at other 
               <lb/>deep Mines. The deepest part of the Mine from the entrance, is 
               <lb/>between 120 and 130 fathoms.
                          </p>
  
               <p>Of the Quick-silver of this Mine they make two sorts: The 
               <lb/>one they call <hi rend="italic">Iungsraw</hi><!-- spelling? -->, that is, <hi rend="italic">Virgin</hi>-Quicksilver; the other, 
               <lb/><hi rend="italic">plain</hi> Quicksilver. <hi rend="italic">Virgin</hi>-Mercury they call that, which disco<lb break="no"/>
               vers it self without the help of Fire; and is either plainly to be 
               <lb/>seen in the Ore, or falls down in little drops in the Mine, and 
               <lb/>sometimes streams out in good quantity; as about seven years 
               <lb/><choice><sic>agoe</sic><corr>ago</corr></choice> it ran out of the Earth at first in a streame as small as a 
               <lb/>thred, and afterwards as big as a pack-thred, but ceas'd in three 
               <lb/>of our dayes.
                          </p>
      
                <p>That also is accounted <hi rend="italic">Virgin</hi>-Quicksilver, which, having no<pb n="1081"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(1081)</fw>
               <lb/>need to pass the fire, is separated by water first in a Sive, and af<lb break="no"/>
               terwards in a long trough, having very small holes at one end. 
                   <lb/>So that there are in a manner two sorts of <hi rend="italic">Virgin</hi>-Mercury; the 
               <lb/>one, running out and discovering itself without labour; the o<lb break="no"/>
               ther, requiring some way of Extraction and separation, though 
               <lb/>not so high an one, as by Fire.
                          </p>
 
               <p><hi rend="italic">Plaine</hi> Quicksilver they name that, which is not at first per<lb break="no"/>
               ceived by the Eye, or falls from the Ore, but is forc'd out by 
               <lb/>Fire. And this they obtaine out of the Ore, or out of the Cin<lb break="no"/>
               naber of Mercury, which they digg out of this Mine. The Ore 
               <lb/>of this Mine is of a dark colour, mix'd with red. But the best 
               <lb/>is an hard stone; which they commit not presently to the opera<lb break="no"/>
               tion of the Fire, but powder it grossly, and work it by the Sive, 
               <lb/>that so, if any <hi rend="italic">Virgin</hi>-quicksilver be found in it, it may be sepa<lb break="no"/>
               rated in this manner, and what doth not pass the Sive, may be 
               <lb/>separated by Fire in Iron-furnaces; Fifty of them in a Fire.
                          </p>
 
               <p>The Quicksilver-ore of this Mine is the richest of all Ores, I 
               <lb/>have yet seen; for ordinarily it contains in it <hi rend="italic">halfe</hi> Quicksilver, 
               <lb/>and in two parts of Ore one part of Quicksilver, and sometimes 
               <lb/>in 3. parts of Ore, two parts of Quicksilver.
                          </p>
    
               <p>I went into the Mine by the Pitt of <name type="place">St. <hi rend="italic">Agatha</hi></name>, and came up 
               <lb/>again by that of <name type="place">St <hi rend="italic">Barbara</hi></name>, descending and ascending by Lad<lb break="no"/>

               <lb/>by Ladders.
                          </p>        

               <p>This Mine, I was inform'd, hath been wrought 200. years, 
               <lb/>about the same space of time with <name type="place"><hi rend="italic">Newsol</hi>-Mine</name>, but <choice><sic>coms</sic><corr>comes</corr></choice> much

                          </p>
     
               <p>I heard no complaint of the <hi rend="italic">Damps</hi> of this Mine, as I have

                          </p>        

               <p>In a Laboratory, where the Quicksilver is separated by Fire, I 
               <lb/>saw an heap of 16000. Retorts of Iron; every one of which costs 
               <lb/>a Crown at the best hand from the Iron-furnaces in <name type="place"><hi rend="italic">Carinthia</hi></name>. 
               <lb/>There are 800. Retorts and as many Recipients employ'd to<lb break="no"/>
               gether, in drawing over the Quicksilver in 16. Furnaces; 50. in 
               <lb/>each Furnace, 25. of a side, 12. above, and 13. below of 
               <lb/>each side.
                          </p>
      
               <p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 12, when I was there, they carried out 40. <hi rend="italic">Saumes</hi> of

               <p>In the Castle I saw 3000 <hi rend="italic">Saumes</hi> of Quicksilver together, in

                          </p>
      
               <p>The Countrys, through which I pass'd, are singularly well

                          </p>
       
               <p>Travelling sometimes in the night, we had continually about

               <p>This Lake is well fill'd with Water for the greatest part of the

               <lb/>the Lake grows lower, and hath for a while shewed some abate<lb break="no"/>

             <p>I took boat at <name type="place"><hi rend="italic">Niderdorf</hi></name>, and went divers miles on the Lake,

             <p>The natural Baths of <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Buda</name></hi> are esteem'd the noblest of <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="64">Europe</name></hi>,

             <lb/>though little curious in most of their private houses, yet are they

                        <lb/>
             <p>There are 8 Baths, whereof I had opportunity to take notice 
             <lb/>during my stay at <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Buda</name></hi>; 3 towards the East and South-East-
             <lb/>part of the City, in the way leading towards <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="1129">Constantinople</name></hi>, and 
             <lb/>5, towards the West-end of the Town in the way towards <hi rend="italic">Old 
                 <lb/>Ossen</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Strigonium</hi>.
             </p>
                        <lb/>
             <p>The first, is a large open Bath at the foot of an high rocky hill, 
             <lb/>formerly called <hi rend="italic">Purgatorium</hi>, whereof the people have some odd 
             <lb/>and scruplous apprehensions.
             </p>
                        <lb/>
             <p>The second is cover'd with a <hi rend="italic">Cupola</hi>, and stands nigh the same 
             <lb/>Hill, but more into the Town, and near a place where they use 
             <lb/>Tanning.
             </p>
                        <lb/>
             <p>The third is called the <hi rend="italic">Bath</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Green Pillars</hi>, though at<pb n="1049"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(1049)</fw>
             <lb/>present they be of a red colour; and it stands over against the <hi rend="italic">Caravansara</hi>.
             <lb/>The water is hot, but tolerable, without addition of cold water. It is impre<lb break="no"/>
             gnated with a Petrifying juyce, which discovers it self on the sides of the

                        <lb/>
             <p>The water is let out at night, when the women have done bathing, who 
             <lb/>often stay late. The Bath is round set about with large Pillars supporting 
             <lb/>a Cupola, which hath openings to let out the steam thereof; and yet the 
             <lb/>whole room continues to be an hot stove.
             </p>
                        <lb/>
             <p>The Baths of the West-end of the Town are I. <hi rend="italic">Tactalli</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Bath of 
             <lb/>the Table</hi>; a small Bath covered: the Water white, and of a Sulphureous 
             <lb/>smell. They drink of this as well as bath in it. What they drink, they re<lb break="no"/>
             ceive from a Spout, bringing the Water into this place. I delivered a <hi rend="italic">five-
             <lb/>sols</hi>-piece to a Turk, bathing in it, to guild for me, which he did in about 
             <lb/>a minute, by rubbing it between his fingers, while the hot water fell from 
             <lb/>the spout upon it.
             </p>
                        <lb/>
             <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Barut Degrimene</hi>, or the Bath of the <hi rend="italic">Powder-mill</hi>. It rises in an 
             <lb/>open pond near the highway, and mixeth with the fresh Springs, so that 
             <lb/>the pond is of a whitish colour in one part, and clear in the other, as also 
             <lb/>cold and hot in several parts. This conveyed cross the high way into a 
             <lb/>Powder-mill, becomes useful in making of Gun-powder. They conceive 
             <lb/>here, that this Bath communicates with the Sulphureous Springs at <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Dotis</name></hi>, 
             <lb/>many miles distant.

             <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Cuzzoculige</hi>, the little Bath or the Bath of the <hi rend="italic">Saint</hi>; for which 
             <lb/>name the Turks give a superstition reason. Tis kept by Turkish Monks. The 
             <lb/>Bath, where the Springs arise, is so hot as scarce to be endured; but being 
             <lb/>let out into another bathing place at some distance, it becomes tolerable and 
             <lb/>fit for use. This water hath neither colour, smell, nor taste different from 
             <lb/>Common water, and deposeth no sediment; onely the sides of the Bath 
             <lb/>are green, and have a fungous substance all over.

                        <lb/>

             <lb/>in the middle; with a circle of a Trench of water about it for the better 
             <lb/>ornament. On every side it has a <hi rend="italic">Nichio</hi>, wherein is a fountain. In the 
             <lb/>middle of the Antichamber (where they leave their cloaths) there is also 
             <lb/>a fair Stone bason and a fountain.
             </p>
                        <lb/>
             <p>5. The Bath of <hi rend="italic">Velibey</hi>; which hath a strong Sulphureous smell, and a<pb n="1050"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(1050)</fw>
             <lb/>petrifying juyce in it; and is so hot, that to make it tolerable, it requires the 
             <lb/>addition of cold water. This is the noblest Bath of any. The Anti-chamber 
             <lb/>very large, the Bath-room cap capacious, and high-arched, and adorned with 
             <lb/>5. Cupola's one a very fair one, over the great round Bath in the middle; 
             <lb/>and one lesser, over each of the 4 corners; where are either Baths or Bath-
             <lb/>stoves for more private use: In these the Turks take off the hair of their 
             <lb/>Bodies by a <hi rend="italic">psilothrum</hi> mixt with soap; it being not their custom, to have 
             <lb/>any hair, except on their beards, and a lock on the crown of their heads. 
             <lb/>Twelve Pillars support the great <hi rend="italic">Cupola</hi>, between 8 whereof are fountains 
             <lb/>of the hot water, and between the other are places to sit down, where the 
             <lb/>Barbers and Bath-men attend. And each of these places have 2 cisterns of 
             <lb/>free-stone, into which are let in hot Bath-water and also cold water, to be 
             <lb/>mixt and tempered as every one pleaseth.

                        <lb/>
             <p><hi rend="italic">Men</hi> bathe in the morning, and <hi rend="italic">Women</hi> in the afternoon. When any 
             <lb/>man intends to bathe, having entred the first rooms, he findes there divers 
             <lb/>servants attending, and furnishing him with a cloth and apron. Then he 
             <lb/>puts off his apparel, and having put on the apron, he entreth the 2d room, 
             <lb/>wherein the great Bath is, and sits on the side of the Bath, or between the 
             <lb/>Pillars nigh a fountain; where the Barber strongly rubs him with his hand 
             <lb/>opened, stretching out his armes, and lifting them up; after which the 
             <lb/>party batheth. Then, if he be a subject of the <hi rend="italic">G. Signors</hi>, or, it be the 
             <lb/>custom of his Countrey, he hath his head shaved, and if a young man, his 
             <lb/>beard, except the upper-lip. Next, the Barber rubs his breast, back, arms 
             <lb/>and legs, with an hair-cloth, while he either sitteth, or lyeth with his 
             <lb/>face downward; then washes his head with soap, and after throws cold 
             <lb/>water upon him all over his Body; and so the party walks about in the 
             <lb/>steam of the Bath for a time.
             </p>
                        <lb/>
             <p>These Baths are made use of two wayes, <hi rend="italic">either</hi> by entring into the wa<lb break="no"/>
              ter, <hi rend="italic">or</hi> sitting about the Bath in the steam. For the vapour of the Bath 
             <lb/>makes the whole room a stove; and most sweat as long as they stay in it; 
             <lb/>and some enter not the water at all, but have it powr'd upon them, or else 
             <lb/>only continue in the steam of the Bath; which sufficiently provoketh 
             <lb/>sweat.

             <lb/>exceeding well, and the Mother having nimble travel, was 
             <lb/>delivered of those prodigious Twins, the <hi rend="italic">effigies</hi> of which is 
             <lb/>here sent you inclosed, (See <hi rend="italic">Table 2. Figure</hi> 1.) together with 
             <lb/>an Accompt of what we thought further worth observa<lb break="no"/>
             tion.
             </p>
             <lb/>   
             <p>This Birth, as you see, had two Heads, and two Necks, 
             <lb/>as also the Eyes, Mouths, and Ears, sutably double. Four 
             <lb/>Arms with Hands, and as many Leggs and Feet. There was 
             <lb/>to both but one Trunk; but two Back-bones, from the <hi rend="italic">Cla<lb break="no"/>
              vicles</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Hypogastrium</hi>, and from the shoulders down to 
             <lb/>the bottom of the Loins they were not distinct, but cement<lb break="no"/>

             <lb/>or Channel-bone of the Right-hand-Child (being long) joyn<lb break="no"/>
             ed with the left <hi rend="italic">Clavicle</hi> of the Left-hand-Child. The Ribbs 
             <lb/>on the face-side of both of them, by the Cartilages or Gristles 
             <lb/>were united without any intervening <hi rend="italic">Sternum</hi> or Brest-bone;<pb n="2097"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(2097)</fw>
             <lb/>and so made a common Chest to them both: And the Ribbs 
             <lb/>of both on the Back-part were united by the Gristles; and 
             <lb/>from the Clavicle down to the <hi rend="italic">Hypogastrium</hi> or bottom of the 
             <lb/>Belly there, were so conjoyned, that they made but one com<lb break="no"/>
             mon Belly, with one Navel-string to them both; but from 
             <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Hypogastrium</hi> downwards they were divided, and became 
             <lb/>two, each having the perfect parts of Females.
             </p>
             <lb/>      
             <p>Having with some difficulty obtained the Fathers leave to 
             <lb/>dissect it, we first weighed this Birth; the weight whereof was 
             <lb/><hi rend="italic">eight</hi> pounds and a <hi rend="italic">quarter</hi>; the Circumference of the left head 
             <lb/>was about <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi> inches, that of the right being half an Inch 
             <lb/>less. The circumference of the Trunk was about <hi rend="italic">sixteen</hi> 
             <lb/>Inches and a <hi rend="italic">quarter</hi>; and the length of both, from head to 
             <lb/>foot, was full <hi rend="italic">eighteen</hi> inches and <hi rend="italic">an half</hi>.
             </p>
             <lb/>   
             <p>We found one Navil-vein, and one Liver, but that was 
             <lb/>very large, with the Bladder of Gall seated in its usual place: 
             <lb/>but there were two Urinary Bladders, two Wombs, four Kid<lb break="no"/>
             neys, and one Stomach, with the <hi rend="italic">Oesophagus</hi> or Gullet perforate 
             <lb/>and open from the Mouth of the left head; but the <hi rend="italic">Oesophagus</hi> 
             <lb/>from the Mouth of the right head descended no lower, than a 
             <lb/>little above half an inch off the Mid-riff, and there it ended. 
             <lb/>No further could we follow it with the probe, but doubting 
             <lb/>a failure in tha Experiment, we made an Essay with a Blow-
             <lb/>pipe, and thereby we found, tha the Wind would go no 
             <lb/>further than the place abovementioned. Whence it may 
             <lb/>be concluded, that the Right-handed Child must have 
             <lb/>received its nourishment by and from the Left Child.
             </p>
             <lb/>   
             <p>There was but one <hi rend="italic">Colon</hi> or Colick gut, which terminated 
             <lb/>into two <hi rend="italic">Intestinarecta</hi><!-- check this spelling:special characters??? -->. So there was but one Midriff, and 
             <lb/>above that, we could find little or no appearance of Lungs; 
             <lb/>but only a very large Heart, (with two Auricles,) the figure of 
             <lb/>which was not Conical, but like a Souldiers <hi rend="italic">pera</hi> or Snapsack, 
             <lb/>or the Ventricle or Stomach; and lying near under the Cla<lb break="no"/>
             vicles, transverse, as the Stomach lyeth under the Midriff and 
             <lb/>Liver. We did also observe two Ventricles with the tricus<lb break="no"/>
             pid or sigmoid-valves; as also the <hi rend="italic">Vena Cava</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aorta</hi> de<lb break="no"/>
             pendant, and also the <hi rend="italic">Aorta</hi> ascending and bifurcate towards 
             <lb/>each neck, and then bifurcate again.<pb n="2098"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(2098)</fw>
             </p>
             <lb/>    
             <p>These Twins were exactly like one another; very well 
             <lb/>featured, having also pretty neat and handsome Limbs. They 
             <lb/>had their hair more than ordinarily thick, and about half an 
             <lb/>Inch long, and the nails full grown.
             </p>
             <lb/>   
             <p>We might have proceeded to further Observations, but 
             <lb/>time and the tumultuous concourse of people, as also the night, 
             <lb/>and likewise the Fathers importunity to hasten the Birth to the 
             <lb/>Grave, hindred us.
             </p>
             <lb/>    
             <p>The Mother is at this time in as good a Condition of 
             <lb/>Health, as Women in Child-bed use to be.

             fore you; in which were lodged many Insects curiously wrapt 
             <lb/>up in green Leaves, in several channels or burrows, each with 
             <lb/>12. 14. or 16. leaves round the Body, and several of them 
             <lb/>with as many little round bites of leaves at each end, to stop 
             <lb/>them up close. These, thus made made up, are near an Inch long 
             <lb/>or the best part of an inch, put in one after another into a bore 
             <lb/>made in the wood, fit for their reception. They are in the 
             <lb/>manner of Cartages of Powder, wherewith Pistols are wont 
             <lb/>to be Charged, or like long slugs of lead, as are sometimes used 
             <lb/>in some parts of those burrows; they are placed so near one 
             <lb/>another as to touch; in others, at some considerable distance. 
             <lb/>These Insects observe this method in placing themselves, that 
             <lb/>sometimes they make a direct way into the length of the 
             <lb/>wood, sometimes they bore out into the side, and run ano<lb break="no"/>
             ther way, those Channels being not unlike the burrows of 
             <lb/>Rabbets; all which they fill up with these round appearances 
             <lb/>of wrapt leaves, all regularly wrought: In which I find ei<lb break="no"/>

             <lb/>dyed there, and is putrified: In some a great number of Mites,<pb n="2099"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(2099)</fw>
             <lb/>of a dark ash-colour, shap'd not unlike common 
             <lb/>Mites; in others, I find seeming excrements of some 
             <lb/>small Insect, with the decayed parts of the dead In<lb break="no"/>
             sect; in others, white Maggots, which you saw. Some 
             <lb/>of these Maggots I took out of their <hi rend="italic">Theca</hi> or bagg, 
             <lb/>and put them in warm places in the Sun; and they 
             <lb/>thereupon grew something bigger, but changed not shape 
             <lb/>nor colour, but dyed. The rest I kept close in a box 
             <lb/>till the eighth of <hi rend="italic">July</hi> present: then I took one of them 
             <lb/>out of the wood, and open'd the leaves, and felt some<lb break="no"/>
             thing stir, hearing also an humming noise like that of a 
             <lb/>Bee; and as soon as I had open'd the <hi rend="italic">Theca</hi>, a perfect 
             <lb/>Bee did fly out against my window, as strongly as a com<lb break="no"/>

             <lb/>again; and they being disturbed, they all eat them<lb break="no"/>
             selves out; and coming home, they were all creep<lb break="no"/>
             ing about my Box, and are since dead there, and 
             <lb/>are these, I here present to your View. They have all 
             <lb/>stings as other Bees have. I had some thoughts at first 
             <lb/>sight, by the yellowish Circles under their Bellies, that 
             <lb/>they might be a sort of Wasps; but now am of opinions,

                <p><choice><orig>BY</orig><reg>By</reg></choice> yours of <hi rend="italic">April</hi> the 20th<!-- Is this April 1670? --> last I find, that you desire to hear 
                    <lb/>some news concerning my Voyage in the <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Upper Egypt</name></hi>. I am 
                    <lb/>very ready to give you that satisfaction, provided you make our 
                    <lb/>friends share in it. I shall therefore tell you, that I have spent three 
                    <lb/>months time in that voyage, accompanied with my Brothers, the 
                    <lb/><name type="person">F. <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi></name> and <hi rend="italic"><name type="person">Francis</name></hi>, alwaies ascending upon the <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="1103">Nile</name></hi> as high as 
                    <lb/>300 leagues above this City, being two daies journey on this side 
                    <lb/>of the Cascata's of the <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="1103">Nile</name></hi>, &amp; where never any French-man hath 
                    <lb/>been within the memory of man. I there admired store of Idol-
                    <lb/>Temples yet entire, together with very ancient Pallaces filled 
                    <lb/>with Statues and Idols. I counted in one place alone 7 <hi rend="italic">Obelisks</hi> 
                    <lb/>like those at <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="70">Rome</name></hi>, and about 120 Columns in one Hall, of the 
                    <lb/>bigness of five Brasses; full within and without, from the top to 
                    <lb/>the bottom, with Hieroglyphic Letters, and with Figures of false 
                    <lb/>Deities. I found Statues of white marble; and some of black of the 
                    <lb/>bigness of three persons, with a sword on their side, and of an 
                    <lb/>hard stone; namely, a Man and a Woman, at the least of the height 
                    <lb/>of eight fathoms, though seated in chairs; but well proportioned: 
                    <lb/>And two others of black marble representing women, with 
                    <lb/>Globes on their head and extravagant coverings thereon, which 
                    <lb/>were two foot broad from one shoulder to the other.
                    </p>
                <lb/>    
                <p>If I had had more time allow'd me to make this Voyage, or 
                    <lb/>had not been obliged to stay long time upon the account of our 
                    <lb/>Mission, in such places where nothing considerable was to be 
                    <lb/>seen, I might have made very curious Observations. There are 
                    <lb/>places where I could not stay to view them but half an hour, 
                    <lb/>which required very well the stay of many hours, and we light<lb break="no"/>
                    ed not but in two places, where Antiquities were to be seen, one 
                    <lb/>whereof is called <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Lozor</name></hi>, and the other <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Candion</name></hi>, which is a very an<lb break="no"/>
                    cient Castle, esteemed by the Tradition of the Country to have 
                    <lb/>formerly been the Residence of a King. Nor indeed is this 
                    <lb/>hard to believe even before one enters into it, considering in 
                    <lb/>the advenues of the said Castle a great number of <hi rend="italic">Sphinxes</hi><pb n="2152"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(2152)</fw>
                    <lb/>standing in a row, and turning their head towards the Alley. 'Tis 
                    <lb/>known that this is an Idol having the Head of a Woman and the 
                    <lb/>Body of a Lion, which was once a famous Deity among the E<lb break="no"/>
                    gyptians. They are distant from each other about two pa<lb break="no"/>
                    ces, and are 20 feet long. I walk'd in four Alleys ending at four 
                    <lb/>Gates of the Castle; and for ought I know there may be more 
                    <lb/>of them, seeing I went but half round the Castle, which is very 
                    <lb/>spacious. I reckon'd 60 of them on one side of one Alley, and 
                    <lb/>as many over against it; and 51 in another Alley; all well mea<lb break="no"/>
                    sur'd. The Alleys are of the largeness of a Pal-mall: the Gates 
                    <lb/>of that Castle are of an extraordinary height cover'd with 
                    <lb/>most excellent stones. Measuring one which maketh the 
                    <lb/>height of one of them, I found it 26 ½ foot long, and proportio<lb break="no"/>
                    nably thick. I believe, that there are above a million of Figures 
                    <lb/>in profil, none in front: I speak of those that are graven 
                    <lb/>on the Walls and Pillars. I should have needed a whole Month 
                    <lb/>to observe all the particulars of that place. I did content my 
                    <lb/>self to draw only the postures of a dozen of the most extrava<lb break="no"/>
                    gant <hi rend="italic">Dæmons</hi> together with their Adorers of both Sexes; and 
                    <lb/>some Frontispieces of Temples, which are not very rich in Ar<lb break="no"/>
                    chitecture, but built of very fine stone. That which most pleas'd 
                    <lb/>me was the ground, where the Azure and the other Colours, 
                    <lb/>which are like enamel, appear as fresh as if they had been laid on 
                    <lb/>but a month before. There are Temples so spacious, that 3000 
                    <lb/>people may stand on the roof with ease. In the same Castle there 
                    <lb/>is a Pond, the water whereof is bitter, set about with fine stones. 
                    <lb/>This water is said perfectly to whiten Linnen all alone; which 
                    <lb/>I tried not, but we dipp'd our handcherchief in it, which kept 
                    <lb/>the sent of Soap for four or five daies.

                <p>These are the only curiosities I can send you of our Voyage 
                    <lb/>which is not the fiftieth part of what was to be seen: but our time

                    <lb/>and the Sett of Inquiries you desire of me. The <hi rend="italic">Fly</hi> is 
                    <lb/>one, if not the very biggest, of the harmless Tribe that 
                    <lb/>I have met with in <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="22">England</name></hi>; I call them <hi rend="italic">harmless</hi>; because 
                    <lb/>that they are without that hard Tongue or Sting in the

                    <lb/>several of them, and found two Baggs of live white 
                    <lb/>worms of a long and round shape, with black heads;

                    <lb/>brought that <hi rend="italic">Stellar Fish</hi> from Sea. I asked all the questi<lb break="no"/>
                    ons I could think needful concerning it. I understood 
                    <lb/>from him, that he never saw nor heard of any but those 
                    <lb/>few, that were taken by himself, which were not above 
                    <lb/>six or seven in all, and those at several times, not far from 
                        <lb/>the Shoals of <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Nantucket</name></hi> (which is an Island upon the Coast

                    <lb/>like Marchantable fish. This <hi rend="italic">Stellar Fish</hi>, when it was a<lb break="no"/>
                    live, and first pull'd out of the water, was like a basket, 
                    <lb/>and had gathered it self round like a Wicker-basket, ha<lb break="no"/>
                    ving taken fast hold upon that bait on the hook, which 
                    <lb/>he had sunk down to the bottom to catch other Fish, and 
                    <lb/>having held <hi rend="italic">that</hi> within the surrounding <hi rend="italic">brachia</hi>, would 
                    <lb/>not let it go, though drawn up into the Vessel; until by ly<lb break="no"/>
                    ing a while on the Deck, it felt the want of its natural E<lb break="no"/>
                    lement, and then voluntarily it extended it self into the flat 
                    <lb/>round form, in which it appear'd when presented to your 
                    <lb/>view.

                    <lb/>
                <p>What motion these fishes had in the water, could not be 
                    <lb/>known to him, for the water was deep, &amp; they could not be 
                    <lb/>seen in any other form than so gather'd up together to hold 
                    <lb/>fast the bait. The only use that could be discern'd of all 
                    <lb/>that curious composure wherewith Nature had adorned it, 
                    <lb/>seems to be, to make it as a pursenet to catch some other 
                    <lb/>fish or any other thing fit for its food, and as a basket of 
                    <lb/>store to keep some of it for future supply, or as a recepta<lb break="no"/>
                    cle to preserve and defend the young ones of the same

                    <lb/>(which appears probable the one or the other;) for that 
                    <lb/>sometimes there were found pieces of Mackerel within

                <p>He added, that he had taken one of this kind of fish the

             <p>But I leave this, and proceed to a remark of my own; and 
                        <lb/>it shall be, if you please, concerning <hi rend="italic">Petrified Shells</hi>; I mean 
                        <lb/>such Shells, as I have observed in our English stone-Quarries. 
                        <lb/>But sir, let me premise thus much, that I am confident, that 
                        <lb/>you at least will acquit me, and not believe me one of a li<lb break="no"/>
                        tigious nature. This I say in reference to what I have lately 
                 <lb/>read in <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="4144">Steno</name>'s <bibl>Prodromus</bibl><!-- which Steno? Create entry for this title --></hi>, that, if my sentiments on this parti<lb break="no"/>
                        cular are somewhat different from hi, it proceeds not from a 
                        <lb/>spirit of contradiction, but from a different view of Nature. 
                        <lb/>First then, we will easily believe, that in some Countries, and 
                        <lb/>particularly along the shores of the <name type="place" ref="765">Mediterranean Sea</name>, there 
                        <lb/>may all manner of Sea shells be found <hi rend="italic">promiscuously</hi> included in 
                        <lb/>Rocks or Earth, and at good distances too from the Sea. But, 
                        <lb/>for our English-inland <hi rend="italic">Quarries</hi>, which also abound with in<lb break="no"/>
                        finite number and great varieties of shells, I am apt to think, 
                        <lb/>there is no such matter, as Petrifying of Shells in the business 
                 <lb/>(or, as <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="4144">Steno</name></hi> explains himself p.84. in the English Version, &amp;

                        <lb/>as they are at present, <hi rend="italic">Lapides sui generis</hi>, and never any part

                        <lb/>that our English Quarry-shells (to continue that abusive name) 
                        <lb/>have no parts of a different Texture from the rock or quarry 
                        <lb/>they are taken, that is, that there is no such thing as <hi rend="italic">shell</hi> in 
                        <lb/>these resemblances of shells, but that Iron-stone Cockles are 
                        <lb/>all Iron stone; Lime or marble all Lime-stone and Marble; 
                        <lb/>Sparre or Chrystalline-shells all Sparre, &amp;c. and that they 
                        <lb/>never were any part of an Animal. My reason is: That Quar<lb break="no"/>

                        <lb/>of shells, not only one from another (as those Cockle-stone;

                        <lb/>but, I dare boldly say, from any thing in nature besides, that 
                        <lb/>either the land, salt, or fresh water doth yeild us. 'Tis true, 
                        <lb/>that I have picked out of that one Quarry of <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">Wansford</name></hi> very 
                        <lb/>resemblances of <hi rend="italic">Murices, Telinæ, Turbines, Cochleæ</hi>, &amp;c. and 
                        <lb/>yet I am not convinced, when I particularly examined some

                        <lb/>fields, that I did ever meet with (N.B.) any one of those

                        <lb/>were not cast in any <hi rend="italic">Animal-mold</hi>, whose species or race is yet

             <lb/>an Apothecary in this City, famous for his diligence in Chy<lb break="no"/>

             <p>As to the occasion and time of its birth, he tels<lb/>me, (My Lord, you may be pleas'd to give firm<lb/>Credit to every particular, 
             that he hath answer<lb break="no"/>ed me at your Grace's instance) it was from a<lb/>winter Sea-voyage, which lasted much longer
             <lb/>than he expected, and wherein he suffered an exceeding cold;<lb/>and that, not long after his landing, he found a certain <hi rend="italic">
              Nodus</hi><lb/>or hard lump in the very place whence this stone was cut. There<lb/>was about 8 years betwixt its breading and being taken away.</p>
                        
             <p>As to its growth, and the inconveniences thence ensuing; he<lb/>further saith, that upon all fresh cold-taking, he suffered much
             <lb/>pain in that part was no more painful than the rest of his mouth. He<lb/>adds, that towards the 7<hi rend="italic">th</hi> and 8<hi rend="italic">th </hi>
             year it did often cause sud<pb n="4063"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(4063)</fw>
             <lb/>sudden swellings in all the Glanduls about the mouth and throat <lb/>upon the first draught of beer at meals; which yet would in a
             <lb/>short time fall again.</p>
                        
             <p>Lastly, as to the particulars remarkable at the time of its be<lb break="no"/>ing taken away, he relates; That it began its work with a sud<lb break="no"/>
             den <hi rend="italic">vertigo</hi>; which vertiginous disposition continued more or<lb/>less from Spring 'till August; in which month, without any
             <lb/><choice><sic>prævious</sic><corr>previous</corr></choice> cause save riding, the place where it was lodged sud<lb break="no"/>
             dainly swelled, and ran purulent matter at the aperture of the<lb/><foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">ductus Whartonianus</foreign>: that it suddainly stopped of its running
             <lb/>(which he cannot attribute to any thing but Cold,) and swelled<lb/>with a great inflammation, and very great danger of choaking;
             <lb/>it being scarce credible, what pain the party suffered in endea<lb break="no"/>vouring to swallow even beer, or any liquid thing.</p>
                        
             <p>This extremity lasted 5 days, in all which time, the party had<lb/>so vast a flux of spittle running from him, that it was not possibe
             <lb/>for him to repose his head to sleep, without wetting all the bed<lb/>about him; insomuch as that it was very much questioned by
             <lb/>some friendly visitants, whether he had not of himself, or by<lb/>mistake, made use of some Mercurial medicine.</p>
                        
             <p>The varieties or degrees of this <hi rend="italic">spontaneous salivation</hi> were such,<lb/>that he urged me not to omit them in the relation I was to make
             <lb/>to your Grace, as thinking them very notable.</p>
                        
             <p>The first day, the <hi rend="italic">saliva</hi> ran thin and transparent, almost like<lb/>water without any bubles. The 2 day it ran frothy; it tasted salt,
             <lb/>(which yet he is apt to think hot rather than really salt, beacuse<lb/>that day the inflammation was at the height). The 3 day it roaped
             <lb/>exceedingly; on which day a small pin-hole broak directly o<lb break="no"/>ver the place of the Stone and ran with purulent matter as for<lb break="no"/>
             merly. The 4 day the <hi rend="italic">saliva</hi> ran <hi rend="italic">insipid</hi>, sensibly cold in the<lb/>mouth; (which again confirms me in that opinion, that the
             <lb/>former sharp tast was the effect of heat, and not the immediate<lb/>quality of a salt humour;) very little frothy. The 5 day (which
             <lb/>was the day of the incision,) it ran as on the 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> but left an ex<lb break="no"/>tream claminess on the teeth, insomuch that they often clave
             <lb/>together, as though they had been joyned together with glue.</p>
                        
             <p>Upon the incision, which proved not wide enough, the mem<lb break="no"/>branes or baggs, wherein the Stone lay, came away first. As to the
             <lb/>Stone it self, it was so hard as to endure the <hi rend="italic">forcipes</hi> in drawing it<pb n="4064"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(4064)</fw>
             <lb/>forth; it was covered over with a grass green matter, which soon<lb/>dryed, and left the stone of a whitish colour, as it is to be seen.
             <lb/>It is but light in proportion to its bulk, weighing about 7 grains;<lb/>and 'tis much of the shape of our ordinary horse-beans. There
             <lb/>are visible impressions upon it of some Capillary and small vess<lb break="no"/>els, it was bred amongst. Lastly, it is scabrous or rough, sand-
             <lb/>like, although the substance is Tophaceous.</p>
                        
             <p>The Accidents accompaning the working away of this Stone, <lb/>(for the incision was merely obsterical,) and the place of its
             <lb/>birth give occasion to call the distemper a <hi rend="italic">Ranula</hi>. Yet in truth<lb/>this was nothing else but one of those Tumours called <hi rend="italic">Atheroma</hi>;
             <lb/>and therefore we will name it <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">lapis Atheromatis</foreign>.</p>

             <p>1. Of the un-common pieces of <hi rend="italic">Coral</hi> red and white; of
             <lb/>both which some are ramified in solid massy bodies; others
             <lb/>(the rarer sort,) are Corallin incrustations upon truly wood<lb break="no"/>

             <lb/>affirm'd to have, upon squeezing them, found a <hi rend="italic">lacteous</hi> Juice.
             <lb/>Himself having been present at the Coral-fishing in the <name type="place">Chan<lb break="no"/>
              nel of <hi rend="italic">Messina</hi></name>, which separates <name type="place" rend="italic" ref="785">Calabria</name> from <name type="place" rend="italic" ref="182">Sicily</name>, relates in

             <lb/>Professor of the Mathematiques at <!-- something missing --><name type="place" ref="1399" rend="italic"/>, that, before the Co<lb break="no"/>ral-fishers drew their nets out of the water,he immersed
             <lb/>his hand and arm into the Sea to feel, whether the Coral was
             <lb/>soft under the water before it was drawn up into the air, and
             <lb/>found it altogether hard, except the round end, above-men<lb break="no"/>
             tioned under the name of button; which having been bruised
             <lb/>with his nails, he found it made up of five or six little cells,
             <lb/>full of a white and somewhat mucilaginous liquor, resembling
             <lb/>that milky Juice, found in Summer in the long cods of the
             <lb/>herb, call'd <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Fluvialis pistana foliis denticulatis</foreign>, spoken of by
             <lb/><name type="person" rend="italic">Joh. Bauhinus</name>. This Corallin juice he calls <hi rend="italic">Leven</hi>, because
             <lb/>having tasted it himself, as well as the Mariners did, they
             <lb/>always found it of a sharp and adstringent taste, in such pie<lb break="no"/>
             ces as came recently out of the Se; those that are dried
             <lb/>loosing that part of the taste which is acrimonious, and re<lb break="no"/>
             taining only that which is adstringent: Which change of
             <lb/>taste he affirms to be made in about six hours after the Coral
             <lb/>hath been drawn up; in which time also the said Leven, that
             <lb/>is inclosed in the pores, is dried, and hath changed its co<lb break="no"/>
             lour. He inclines strongly to the opinion of those who con<lb break="no"/>
             ceive, that the long concoction of the ferment fixes the parts,
             <lb/>and produces the red colour, especially being near to the
             <lb/>hard coral, and the red vermillion, which surrounds it.</p>

                        <lb/><p>This Observer, having engaged the ingenious <name type="person">Monsieur
             <lb/><hi rend="italic">Guisony</hi></name> to impart to him his thoughts concerning that famous
             <lb/>Question, <hi rend="italic">Whether Coral be a Vegetable</hi>, received for answer,
             <lb/>That 'tis so far from being a Plant, that 'tis a meer Mineral,
             <lb/>composed of much Salt and a little Earth; and that 'tis form'd
             <lb/>into that substance by a precipitation of divers Salts, that en<lb break="no"/>
             sues upon the encounter of the Earth with those Salts; after
             <lb/>the manner of the known Metallique Tree, which in a very

             tion of Mercury and Silver, dissolv'd in <hi rend="italic">Aqua fortis</hi>, and after<lb break="no"/>
             wards cast into common water; the parts of this Mineral and
             <lb/>Metal joining themselves to one another. Which thing also
             <lb/>happens in some subterraneous Grotto's, where by a continual
             <lb/>and long fall of water-drops many sorts of figures, and, a<lb break="no"/>
             mongst them, shapes of little trees are formed. This senti<lb break="no"/>
             ment he confirms by alledging, that he can shew a Salt of Co<lb break="no"/>
             ral, which, being cast into water, and there dissolved, upon the
             <lb/>evaporation of that water by a gentle heat is presently coa<lb break="no"/>
             gulated, and converted into store of small sticks, resembling
             <lb/>a little forrest.</p>
                        
             <p>2. A certain stony substance, that is fissile, and hath the
             <lb/>scent of <hi rend="italic">bitumen</hi>, complicated and laid together membran-
             <lb/>like, and found in the <name type="place"><hi rend="italic">Hyblean</hi> mountains</name> of <name type="place" rend="italic" ref="182">Sicily</name>, near <name type="place" rend="italic">Mi<lb break="no"/>

             <p>3. A not ordinary <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">sangui-suga</foreign> or Leech. found sticking fast
             <lb/>in the fish called <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Xiphias</foreign> or Sword-fish, slightly mention'd by
             <lb/><name type="person" rend="italic" ref="121">Gesner</name> in his book <bibl rend="italic">de Aquatilibus</bibl>
             , and <name type="person" rend="italic">Johnston</name> in his book <bibl rend="italic">de
                 <lb/>Piscibus</bibl>. Our presenter gives it the name of <hi rend="italic">Hirudo</hi> or <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Acus
                <lb/>caudâ utrinque pennatâ</foreign>, because of its working it self into the
             <lb/>flesh, and sucking the blood of the said Fish. He describes it to
             <lb/>be of about four inches long; the belly of it white, cartilagi<lb break="no"/><pb n="6160"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(6160)</fw>
             <lb/>nous and transparent; without eyes or head (that he could
             <lb/>observe,) but in stead of a head, it hath a hollow snout encom<lb break="no"/>
             passed with a very hard membrane, differing in colour and
             <lb/>substance from the belly; which snout it thrusts whole into
             <lb/>the body of the fish, (as strongly as an auger is wound into a
             <lb/>piece of wood,) and fills it full of blood unto the very ori<lb break="no"/>
             fice. It hath a tail shaped like a feather, serving for its moti<lb break="no"/>
             on, and, under it, two filamenst or slender fibres, longer than
             <lb/>the whole Insect, whereby, it seems, it clings about stones or
             <lb/>herbs, and sticks the closer in the body of the Sword-fish; of
             <lb/>which it attacks those parts only, where the fins of the fish
             <lb/>cannot touch or trouble it; the Observer affirming, that he
             <lb/>hath often found it sticking in the back and in the belly, and
             <lb/>sometimes close to the head, sometimes close to the tail of that
             <lb/>fish, but always far enough from the fins. Within its belly he
             <lb/>noted some vessels, like small guts, reaching from one end of it
             <lb/>to the other, which by the pressure of his nail he made reach
             <lb/>to the orifice of the snout, whence they retired back of them<lb break="no"/>
             selves to their natural scituation; they seeming to be the in<lb break="no"/>
             struments for sucking the blood, because the snout is in it self
             <lb/>an empty part, destitute of fibres and valves to draw and suck
             <lb/>with; whereas these vessels have a motion resembling that of
             <lb/>a pump, in which the snout of this animal serves for a sucker,
             <lb/>drawing the blood from end to the other: And the belly
             <lb/>of this Insect being framed ring-wise, the structure serves to
             <lb/>thrust the said inner vessels unto the orifice of the trunk, and
             <lb/>to draw them back again. This creature as it torments the
             <lb/>Swordfish, so it is, by our bservers relation, vexed it self by
             <lb/>another Insect, which he calls a <hi rend="italic">Lowse</hi>, of an ash colour, fastened
             <lb/>towards the tail of this Leech as fermly, as a sea-snail is to a
             <lb/>rock. 'Tis of the bigness of a pea, and hath an opening, whence
             <lb/>come out many small winding and hairy threds. It hath not

             <lb/>sold in shops, being a concrete of Niter, Sulphur and Vitriol

                <lb/>forth Tufts of long and slender fibres or threads; some of them half

                <lb/>these Tufts were in some measure transparent and crystalline. These

                <lb/>    
            <p>The water, wherein the Allom-fibres were dissolv'd, did give no

                <lb/>They are channelled the length-way, and upon the ridges knotted 
                <lb/>or purled all over with small knots, set in a quincunx-order. The in<lb break="no"/>
                ward substance is a white opaque Sparr, and breaks smooth like a 
                <lb/>flint; not at all hollow in th emiddle, as are the <hi rend="italic">Eelemnites</hi>.

                <lb/>    
            <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Of the Electrical power of Stones in relation to a Vegetable Rosin</hi>.
                <lb/>It so hapned, that having occasion in <hi rend="italic">July</hi> to view certain Fos<lb break="no"/>
                sils, which I had dispos'd of into divers Drawers in a Cabinet made 
                <lb/>of <hi rend="italic">Barbados Cedar</hi>, I observ'd many of the stones to be thick-cover'd 
                <lb/>over with a liquid Rosin like Venice Turpentine. Examining fur<lb break="no"/>
                ther, there was not a Drawer, wherein there was not some more some 
                <lb/>fewer stones thus drenched.
                </p>
                <lb/>   
            <p>That this could be no mistake, as from dropping, the bottoms of 
                <lb/>the Drawers are of Oak. Again, many stones, which were lapped up 
                <lb/>in papers, were yet wholly infected <!-- possibly insected? -->and cover'd with this Rosin. Be<lb break="no"/>
                sides, after diligent search there appear'd no manner of exudation 
                <lb/>in any part of the Cabinet.
                </p>
                <lb/>  
            <p>Two things I thought very remarkable: 1. That of the many sorts 
                <lb/>of Stones I therein had, divers escaped, but not any of the <hi rend="italic">Hæma<lb break="no"/>
                tites</hi>-kind; having therein <hi rend="italic">Manganes, Scistos, Botryades,</hi> &amp;c. which 
                <lb/>were all deeply concern'd. 2. That amongst perhaps 500 pieces, of 
                <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Astroites</hi> here and there one or two in an apartment, and some<lb break="no"/>
                times more, were seised<!-- what word is this? -->, and the rest dry; as it fares with people in the 
                <lb/>time of the Plague in one and the same house. I further observed, 
                <lb/>that stones of a soft and open grain, as well as those of a hard and 
                <lb/>polish't <hi rend="italic">supersicies</hi>, were concern'd in a manner alike.
                </p>
                <lb/>   
            <p>'Tis certain, that the whole body of the Turpentine of the Ce<lb break="no"/>
                dar-wood was carried forth into the Air, and floating therein was 
                <lb/>again condensed into its own proper form upon these stones.
                </p>
                <lb/>   
            <p>This makes it more than probable, that Odoriferous bodies emit 
                <lb/>and spend their very substance. Thus <hi rend="italic">Camphir</hi> is said, if not well se<lb break="no"/>
                cured, totally to fly away. Again, it is hence evident, that there is<pb n="225"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(225)</fw>
                <lb/>great difference betwixt the <hi rend="italic">Distillation</hi> of Vegetable Juyces, and 
                <lb/>the <hi rend="italic">Emission</hi> of Effluviums or this <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> Distillation; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> really 
                <lb/>separating and dividing the substance into different parts; but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> 
                <lb/>carrying out the whole entirely and un-alter'd in its nature.
                </p>
                <lb/>   
            <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Of the Flower and Seed of Mushroms.</hi>
                <lb/>The general and received opinion of <hi rend="italic">Botanists</hi> concerning <hi rend="italic">Mush<lb break="no"/>
                roms</hi> is that, which <hi rend="italic">Caspar Bauhinus</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Pinax</hi> expresses in these 
                <lb/>few words, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Fungi neq; plantæ, neq; radices, neq; flores, neq; semina 
                <lb/>sunt; sed nihil aliud quàm terræ, arborum, lignorum putridorum, alia<lb break="no"/>
                rúmq, putrilaginum humiditates supersluæ.</hi> I am of the opinion, that 
                <lb/>they are Plants of their own kind, &amp; have more than a chance-original. 
                <lb/>We will instance in that <hi rend="italic">species</hi>, called <hi rend="italic">Fungus porofus crassus magnus</hi> 
                <lb/>J.B. The texture of the Gills is like a paper prickt ful of pin-holes. 
                <lb/>In <hi rend="italic">August</hi> this is very frequent under hedges, and in the middle of 
                <lb/>the Moors in many places of this Country. It seems to me (and, no 
                <lb/>doubt, it will to any person that shall well examine it, that the Gills 
                <lb/>of this Mushrom are the very flower and seed of this Plant. When it 
                <lb/>is ripe, the Gills here are easily separable from the rest of the head: 
                <lb/>Each seed is distinct from other, and hath its impression in the head 
                <lb/>of the Mushrom, just as the seeds of an Artichoak hath in the bot<lb break="no"/>
                tom of it. The bigger end of the seed is full and round; and they are 
                <lb/>disposed in a spiral order just as those of the Artichoak. The like 
                <lb/>we do think of all other Mushroms, however differently figured. 
                </p>
                <lb/>
            <p>And if it shall happen to him that shall sow them, that these will 
                <lb/>not produce their kind, but be steril; it is no strange thing amongst 
                <lb/>Plants, there being whole genus's of Plants that come up, and flower, 
                <lb/>and seed, and yet their seed was never known to produce Plants of 
                <lb/>their kind, being naturally steril, and a volatil dust, as all the <hi rend="italic">Orchides</hi> 
                <lb/>or <hi rend="italic">Bee-flowers</hi>.
                </p>
                <lb/>   
            <p>We shall not here omit to tell you further concerning this Mush<lb break="no"/>
                rom, that, when fresh gather'd, it is of a buff-colour inside outside; 
                <lb/>and yet, cut through the middle, it will in a moment change from a 
                <lb/>pale-yellow to a deep purple or blew, and stain linnen according<lb break="no"/>
                ly. A drop of the juyce, leisurely squeezed out, will change, holding 
                <lb/>it betwixt your eye and the light, through all the colours of the 
                <lb/>Rainbow, in the very time of its falling, and six in a purple, as it 
                <lb/>doth in the springing out of its veins.

                <lb/>  
            <p>VII. <hi rend="italic">Of the speedy vitrifying of the whole body of Antimony by Cawk.</hi>
                <lb/>The several vitrifications of <hi rend="italic">Antimony</hi> are either opaque or trans<lb break="no"/>
                parent. To the first kind I shall add one, which is in it self very curi<lb break="no"/>
                ous, and hath these advantages above the rest, that it is done with<pb n="226"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(226)</fw>
                <lb/>great ease and speed; and by it I have performed some things upon 
                <lb/>Minerals and Mettals, which with crude Antimony alone I could 
                <lb/>not effect.
                </p>
                <lb/>  
            <p>Take of Antimony one pound; flux it clear: Have an ounce or 
                <lb/>two of the Cawk-stone (by and by to be described) in a lump red-
                <lb/>hot in readiness. Put it into the Crucible to the Antimony; continue 
                <lb/>the flux a few minutes: Cast it into a clean and not greased Mortar, 
                <lb/>decanting the melted liquor from the Cawk.
                </p>
                <lb/>   
            <p>This Process gives us above 15 ounces of <hi rend="italic">vitrium</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Antimony</hi>, 
                <lb/>like polish't Steel, and as bright as the most refined Quicksilver. 
                <lb/>The Cawk seems not to be diminish't in its weight, but rather in<lb break="no"/>
                creased; nor will be brought to incorporate with the Antimony, 
                <lb/>though flux't in a strong blast.
                </p>
                <lb/>   
            <p>This Cawk-stone is a very odd Mineral, and I always looked up<lb break="no"/>
                on it to be much a kin to the white milky Mineral juyces, I formerly 
                <lb/>sent you a <hi rend="italic">specimen</hi> of: And this Experiment is demonstrative, that I 
                <lb/>was not mistaken; for, the milky juyce of the Lead-Mines vitrifies 
                <lb/>the whole body of Antimony in like manner. 
                </p>
                <lb/>   
            <p>That this Vitrification is from the <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> nature of Cawk, I little 
                <lb/>doubt; for, I could never light upon any one mineral substance, 
                <lb/>which had any such effect upon Antimony; and I have tryed very 
                <lb/>many, as <hi rend="italic">Lapis Calaminaris</hi>, Stone-Sulphur or <hi rend="italic">Sulphur vivum, Gala<lb break="no"/>
                ctites, Sulphur Marcasite, Allom-glebe</hi>, divers <hi rend="italic">Sparrs</hi>, &amp;c.
                </p>
                <lb/>  
            <p>Cawk is a ponderous white stone, found in the Lead-Mines; it will 
                <lb/>draw a white line like Chawk or the <hi rend="italic">Galactites</hi>: And though it be 
                <lb/>so free, that it is more firm, and hath a smooth and shining grain, 
                <lb/>Sparr-like, yet not at all transparent. Of the Spirit, it yields by di<lb break="no"/>

              <lb/>this Fire affordeth no inconsiderable quantity thereof, especially <lb/>in dry weather; some of which I have sent by

             <p>Besides this, I took occasion lately to visit a poor Woman <lb/>in the neighbouring Parish, who hath been 
             of a long time sadly <lb/>afflicted with the Gravel, and hath passed four Stones of an un<lb break="no"/>usual

             inches about <lb/>the one way, and four, the other: which, if you please, shall <lb/>be sent you. They are all oval; 
             the first, and a part of the second <lb/>were smooth; but the other two very rough; and the last, the <lb/>biggest,

             shining in the dark like a <lb/>glowing Coal, after it hath been a while exposed to the Day <lb/>or Candle-light; the 
             other, the <hi rend="italic">Bononian</hi> Stone calcin’d, which <lb/>imbibes light from the Sun-beams, and so renders 
             it again in <lb/>the dark, whereas the former needs no Shining Sun, but doth <lb/>the effect in quite overcast weather 
             and even in a misty day. <lb/>To these we shall now add two other sorts. The <hi rend="italic">one</hi> is by the 
             <lb/><hi rend="italic">Germans</hi> called <hi rend="italic">Phosphorus Smaragdinus</hi>, said to be of this 
             na<lb break="no"/>ture, that it collects its light not so much from the Sun-beams, <lb/>or the illuminated Air, 
             as from the Fire it self; seeing that, if <lb/>some of it be laid upon a Silver or Copper-plate, under which <lb/>are 
             put some live coals, or a lighted Taper, it will presently <lb/>shine, and if the same matter be shaped into Letters, one is 
             <lb/>able to read it, the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> is called <hi rend="italic">Phosphorus Fulgurans</hi>, which 
             <lb/>is a matter, made both in a liquid and dry form, and not only <lb/>shineth in the dark, and communicates a sudden light to such 
             <lb/>bodies as 'tis rubbed on; but, being included in a Glass-<lb/>vessel well closed, doth now and then fulgurate, and sometimes 
             <lb/>also raise it self as 'twere into waves of light: Differing very <lb/>much from the <hi rend="italic">Balduinian</hi> Stone, 
             which is to be exposed to <lb/>some shining Body, as the Day, the Sun, the Fire or some <lb/>lighted Candle, to receive light from thence; 
             whereas this <lb/>Fulgurating substance carries its light alwaies with it, and when <lb/>put in a dark place, presently shews the 
             same. Of which we <lb/>have this further assurance given us, that a little portion of it, <lb/>having been kept two whole 
             years, hath not yet lost its power <lb/>of shining: So that 'tis believed, if a considerably big piece <lb/>were prepared of 
             it, it would serve for a perpetual, or, at least, <lb/>a very long lasting light.

             <p>SIR,
             <lb/><choice><orig>SInce</orig><reg>Since</reg></choice> you gave me some specimens of the water of <hi rend="italic">La<lb break="no"/>
              tron</hi>, and likewise of <hi rend="italic">Nitrian Nitre</hi>, I have found<lb/>
             that those Descriptions which the Antients give of it,<lb/>
             exactly agree with those specimens we have here; their<lb/>
             encomiums of it were so many, but so different the names<lb/>
             which they ascribed to it, as a sceptic indeed might e<lb break="no"/>
             qually question whether or no they writ of any thing<lb/>
             else, or whether or no they writ of ay such thing.<lb/>
             That we might therefore the better understand the wri<lb break="no"/>
             tings of the Antients concerning it, and the <hi rend="italic">Phænomena</hi><lb/>
             which it afforded here, I have thought convenient to<lb/>
             make use of this method. I shall in the first place shew<lb/>
             whence <hi rend="italic">Nitre</hi> has its denomination. In the second, the<lb/>
             different names which ancient Authors ascribe to it. In<lb/>

             fourth, a description of it as it is when a <hi rend="italic">Compositum</hi>. In<lb/>
             the fifth, the number of ts principles when chymically<lb/>

            <p>A worthy Gentleman, who for many years has been
                <lb/>a Considerable adventurer in the Lead Mines on
                <lb/><name type="place"><hi rend="italic">Mendip</hi> hills</name>, being in <name type="place">London</name> a while since, was pleas'd 
                <lb/>to acquaint me that the Miners there, within these

                <lb/>with Gunpowder, whereupon I desir'd he would please 
                <lb/>to favour me with a Present of the Instruments us'd in it, 
                <lb/>which I conceiv'd would not be unacceptable in the Re<lb break="no"/>
                pository at Gresham Colledge, where I have now caus'd 
                <lb/>them to be deliuered.</p>
                
            <p>The first Instrument, which by the miners is call'd the 
                <lb/><hi rend="italic">Borier</hi> described <hi rend="italic">Fig. 7</hi> is made of Iron, and is 2 foot 2 In<lb break="no"/>
                ches in length, it is an Inch square at the steeled end from 
                <lb/><hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, and somewhat lesse in the other part: the use of this 
                <lb/>Instrument is to make a hole in the Rock deep enough to 
                <lb/>receive the Powder: the second Instrument, call'd the <hi rend="italic">Gun</hi>
                <lb/>represented <hi rend="italic">Fig</hi>. 8. is 6. Inches in length, 1¼ diameter,
                <lb/>and has a hole drill'd through it to receive the priming 
                <lb/>Powder. The first Instrument is manag'd thus, one 
                <lb/>man holds it on the Rock and turns it round, while ano<lb break="no"/>
                ther beats it down with a hammer of five or six pounds 
                <lb/>weight; when the hole is made somewhat deeper then 
                <lb/>the length of the <hi rend="italic">Gun</hi>, they dry it with a rag, and put in<lb break="no"/>
                to it about 2 or 3 Ounces of Powder, over which they put 
                <lb/>a thin paper, and on it place the <hi rend="italic">Gun</hi>, which they bind 
                <lb/>firmly into the hole, by driving in against the flat side of

                down, the tooles may strike fire and kindle the Powder.</p>
                
            <p>In <bibl n="1369">number: 5. of the Philosoph. Transact</bibl>. set forth
                <lb/>by <name type="person">Mr. <hi rend="italic">Oldenburg</hi></name> there is a way of breaking Rocks with

                wise Inserted.</p>
                
            <p>I know the use of these Instruments will be of great 
                <lb/>advantage to Miners, and if there are any Minerall works 
                <lb/>where they are not yet receiv'd, the Miners may doe well 
                <lb/>to try them; for (beside what will be sav'd in timber in a

                <lb/>and broken the Rock, he may presently go to work a<lb break="no"/>

                <lb/>worm, which is reported to be the only poysonous
                <lb/>Animal in our Kingdome; but whether it be really 
                <lb/>so, or not, I cannot assert on my own experience. That 
                <lb/>from which the figures were taken, was sent alive to me, 
                <lb/>from the Country, about 40. miles from <name type="place" n="395">Dublin</name>. The 
                <lb/>Gentleman that sent it, had kept it above six weeks in 
                <lb/>a large Box on a Grassy sod, now and then giving it a 
                <lb/>fresh sod, and Ragwort to eat, besprinkling them with 
                <lb/>Dew. Before I could get the figures taken, the creature 
                <lb/>was so unquiet, I was forced to stifle it, as Huswives do 
                <lb/>their Bees, with the fume of sulphur. When the Gen<lb break="no"/>
                tleman first took it, it was much smaller then when he 
                <lb/>sent it to me, proposing some Queries to him concerning 
                <lb/>it, the chief whereof were, whether he had any certain 
                <lb/>Experiment to prove them Venemous? What Symptomes 
                <lb/>attended the Beasts affected by them? And what cures 
                <lb/>were applyed to them?</p>

            <p>But that I may give you my own sentiments, I am
                <lb/>very apt to suspect that this Worm is no more poyson
                <lb/>then other <choice><sic>Catterpillers</sic><corr>Catterpillars</corr></choice> (for 'tis of the <choice><sic>Catterpiller</sic><corr>Catterpillar</corr></choice>

                glished by the most learned and ingenious <name type="person" rend="italic" ref="25">Dr. Lister</name>, you
                <lb/>will find the very same Animal as this I speak of; but
                <lb/>at present I have not that book by me, having sent it to 
                <lb/>my Brother in <name type="place" rend="italic" n="456">Holland</name>. I never had, or have seen, but
                <lb/>this one, and so I would make no experiment therewith,
                <lb/>being forced (as I told you,) to kill it. But I verily be<lb break="no"/>
                lieve that the Ugliness of the Worm (it being of a dark
                <lb/>fuscous, and as they say, poysonous color,) together with
                <lb/>its largeness beyond common <choice><sic>Catterpillers</sic><corr>Catterpillars</corr></choice>, has wrought
                <lb/>so upon the fearfull and ignorant Vulgar, that they have 
                <lb/>given it the name of Venemous. As to the Gentlemans
                <lb/>forementioned Reasons, they are but conjectures, and as
                <lb/>such I submit them to your judgement; and my negative
                <lb/>opinion has much the same foundation, for I find the
                <lb/>People of our Country much in the wrong in some parti<lb break="no"/>
                culars relating to the Animal, which makes me suspect
                <lb/>they may be in an error relating to its poyson. For first
                <lb/>tis commonly asserted by them, that the two spots
                <lb/>marked <hi rend="italic">dd</hi> Fig: 1. are Google Eyes, whereas they are
                <lb/>nothing more then two Variegated spots of a colour dif<lb break="no"/>
                ferent from the rest of the Back. Secondly, they assert
                <lb/>likewise, that the part marked <hi rend="italic">e</hi> Fig: 1. is a sting, where<lb break="no"/>
                as this Protuberance in the Tail is common with it to
                <lb/>severall other <choice><sic>Catterpillers</sic><corr>Catterpillars</corr></choice>, and the greater the Catter<lb break="no"/>
                <choice><sic>piller</sic><corr>pillar</corr></choice>, the larger this Horn. So that if their fear or
                <lb/>abhorrence of the Worm may make them believe those
      <pb n="879"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(879)</fw>
                <lb/>parts <choice><sic>Eys</sic><corr>Eyes</corr></choice> that are not, and that part a Sting, which is
                <lb/>not at all like it, contrary to the plain View of the Crea<lb break="no"/>
                ture; It may likewise make them imagin it poysonous,
                <lb/>when it is no such thing. But yet I will not conceal what
                <lb/>I have from another Gentleman (but with some diffi<lb break="no"/>
                dence of the Experiment,) he gave the juice of one of
                <lb/>these Worms to one Dog, which shewed no alteration 
                <lb/>thereon, but another Dog, to whom he gave the skin of
                <lb/>the Creature, was found dead three dayes after; but
                <lb/>whether his death proceeded from the poysonous skin,
                <lb/>he could not assert; for the Dog ran at liberty, and
                <lb/>might have been kild (for ought as he knew,) by some
                <lb/>other Accident, tho' no externall sign of any Violence
                <lb/>offer'd to him did appear. But leaving these conjectures,
                <lb/>I come to what is evident to the senses (and expe<lb break="no"/>

                        and therefore have presumed to communicate it to you.</p>

             <p>This Operation was performed to the satisfaction of<lb/>

                        the Patient had some ease for the present.</p>

             <p>I had quite given over this Enquiry, when there acci<lb break="no"/>dentally fell into my hands a <hi rend="italic">Terella</hi> 
             or Spherical Load-<lb/>stone, of three Inches Diameter; with which being mind<lb break="no"/>ed to make some Experiments, with a 
             little Needle whose <lb/>foot might easily be placed upon the Stone, I soon Obser<lb break="no"/>ved that which hath been already 
             noted by several, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi><lb/>that this Globe of Magnet caused the Needle to have the <lb/>same changes which 
             are found in the Compass in diffe<lb break="no"/><pb n="346"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(346)</fw><lb/>rent parts of the World, 
             as well in respect of the directi<lb break="no"/>on towards the two Poles, as of the Inclination towards <lb/>that which is next it: 
             And upon tryal I satisfied myself <lb/>that it was not possible to find the Point where the <choice><sic>Nee
              <lb break="no"/>ple</sic><corr>Nee<lb break="no"/>dle</corr></choice> would stand indifferently in any position, (which 
             <lb/>Point would have exactly shewed me the Pole of the <lb/>Stone) but that the Needle however placed always direct<lb break="no"/>ed itself some one way. I determined by this means, as <lb/>well as I could, the Point called the South Pole; but I 
             <lb/>was much surprized to find it 18 Degrees distant from a <lb/>Cross deep engraven on the Stone, which according to all 
             <lb/>appearance had heretofore been the Pole of this Stone, <lb/>as it had been Observed by him that Cut it. This change 
             <lb/>of the Poles of this Stone having revived my former <lb/>thoughts concerning the Variation of the Needle, I believ<lb break="no"/>ed that if it were true that the Poles of the Magnetical <lb/>Vertue changed in the Loadstone, as we see they change 
             <lb/>in the Earth, one might derive great advantages there<lb break="no"/>from as to the Variations of the Magnetical Needle.</p>

             see if there be any sensible altera<lb break="no"/>tion in the Poles thereof: And upon tryal it was found <lb/>that the Points

             that the Variation has changed at <lb/><name type="place" rend="italic">London</name> full 4 Degrees since this 
             <hi rend="italic">Terella</hi> has been in the So<lb break="no"/>ciety’s Custody; and perhaps many more since it was mark<lb break="no"/>ed: and had there been a change in the Poles of the Load-<lb/>stone analagous thereto, it must needs have 
             been perceived <lb/>in this, whose Diameter is about 4 ½ Inches. However to <lb/>put this matter past dispute, 
             care was taken to find out ex<lb break="no"/>actly and mark the Poles of the Society’s great Load-stone, 
             <lb/>the Sphere of whose activity is above 9 Foot Radius, and <lb/>whose Poles are 13 Inches asunder, whereby if this Trans<lb break="no"/>lation of the Poles be real, it cannot fail of being made <lb/>very sensible in future times. As to the 
             supposition that the <lb/>Points in which the Iron hath received the Magnetical Ver<lb break="no"/>tue may change place, 
             after the same manner as the Poles <lb/>of the Earth’s Magnetism are observed to do; tho’ it was <lb/>lookt upon as an

             <lb/>opinion, rather that such a Circular Needle would librate <lb/>on its Center, so as to respect the Magnetical Meridian with 
             <lb/>the Points that had at first received the touch, than that <lb/>the Ring remaining immoveable, the derective Vertue should 
             <lb/>be transferred therein from place to place, either by length <lb/>of time, or by transporting this Compass into those parts where 
             <lb/>the Variation of the Needle is considerably different.</p>

             <p>SIR, <lb/><choice><orig>’TIS</orig><reg>’Tis</reg></choice> almost 28 years since I travelled into 
              <name type="place" rend="italic">Russia</name>, <lb/>and being there merely for my own Satisfaction, 
                 <lb/>I not only Conversed with the Inhabitants of those Coun<lb break="no"/>treys, but with <hi rend="italic">Tartars
              </hi> of all sorts. There I grew first <lb/>informed not only in the Situation of those Parts, but <lb/>of such 
              Countries as lay very remote. I have not ceas<lb break="no"/>ed from that time, by various Methods I have found, to 
                 <lb/>send Letters unto, and receive Answers from the most <lb/>Northern, and North-East parts of the World. For I have 
                 <lb/>maintain’d a constant Correspondence in <name type="place" rend="italic">Mosco</name>, <name type="place" rend="italic">Astra<lb break="no"/>can</name>, <name type="place" rend="italic">Georgia</name>, <name type="place" rend="italic">Ispahan</name>, 
              <name type="place" rend="italic">Polonia</name>, and <name type="place" rend="italic">Constantinople</name>, I have 
                 <lb/>had Letters every year from <name type="place" rend="italic">Pekin</name>, the chief City of 
                 <lb/><name type="place" rend="italic">China</name>. I have gathered Volumes of Journals and Re<lb break="no"/>gisters, 
              which set forth the Names of Mountains, Rivers, <lb/>Cities and Towns, together with a vast number of 
                 <lb/>Drafts made by my own Order, which describe the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories that I have mentioned.</p>
             
             <p>’Tis from this Fund, which has been gathering for so <lb/>many years, and by comparing and adjusting all these 
                 <lb/>Materials, and by preserving without intermission there<lb break="no"/>in, that the Map is made up.</p>

           <fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(494)</fw>
             
             <lb/><p>After all, I am far from thinking it has no faults, ‘tis <lb/>very well if such as are found, be not many, or very 
                 <lb/>gross, I confess my own greatest doubts are about the <lb/>stretching of the Sea-Coasts. And ‘tis therefore that I 
                 <lb/>express them in a faint and pale Colour, to signify the <lb/>uncertainty thereof. But as to the Latitudes, I have 
                 <lb/>more assurance of their being well noted, and suspect <lb/>but little mistakes, if there be any therein.</p>
             
             <p>I am yet in suspence whether the North-East Point <lb/>which you see bearing off in the Map, may run quite on 
                 <lb/>to <name type="place" rend="italic">America</name>; or how far thither-ward it may reach.</p>
             
             <p>I formerly thought <name type="place" rend="italic">Nova Zembla</name> had been a Continent, 
                 <lb/>and when I wrote my Opinion herein to <name type="person">Mr. <hi rend="italic">Oldenbourg</hi></name>, 
                 <lb/>he put it into one of his Transactions. But I have since <lb/>been better informed, and retracted that Error. And 
                 <lb/>whereas the late <name type="person"> Monsieur <hi rend="italic">Vossius</hi></name> would needs persuade 
                 <lb/>himself, as well as he did others to their Ruin, that <lb/>there was a passage to <name type="place" rend="italic">Japan</name> 
              by the North, and that the <lb/><hi rend="italic">Tartarian</hi> Countreys behind <name type="place" rend="italic">Nova Zembla</name> 
              did immediate<lb break="no"/>ly decline towards the South; I did always oppose it, <lb/>and think I can even demonstrate the Impossibility there<lb break="no"/>of. So that what he wrote to encourage Mariners to <lb/>that attempt, was even directing them to the point of 
                 <lb/>Death, as it afterwards ensu’d.</p>
             
             <p>My intention is, if I live, and may have leisure for <lb/>it, to make several particular Maps of the sundry Coun<lb break="no"/>tries contained in this General One, and to give the De<lb break="no"/>scriptions which appertain to each.</p></div>

             <lb/>These Shells contain a Fish that lives in the bottom of <lb/>the Sea, fixt to the Body of the Shell, and at a certain

             <lb/>are so many <hi rend="italic">Matrices</hi>, each producing its little shell-<lb/>fish; which quit not their cells till they are grown to
             <lb/>such a bigness and maturity, as their weight breaks them<lb/>off and loosens them from their cells, and so from their
             <lb/>common <hi rend="italic">Matrix</hi>, which remains fastned to the bottom<lb/>of the Sea by the great end, the other end moving a<lb break="no"/>bout freely in the water, which is flexible every way<lb/>like an <hi rend="italic">Andouille</hi>. This

             <p>It is observable that this <hi rend="italic">Matrix</hi> has a kind of back-<lb/>part and Belly, the Back is something like that of a

                    made of an Iron <hi rend="italic">Convex</hi> Plate, wrought hollow on the inside,<lb/>
                    to receive the Gladiator’s Hand, upon the Center of this is a<lb/>
                    lesser Boss, wherein there seems to have been fixed, some<lb/>
                    kind of <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Cuspis</foreign>, or sharp offensive Weapon, to be used when<lb/>
                    they came to fight Hand to Hand, but the Form of this I<lb/>
                    cannot describe, both the Sheilds being defective in that point;<lb/>
                    nor can I receive any Light from my Collection of Coins, for<lb/>
                    tho’ it seem to be the same that <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Mars Bellator</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Gradivus</foreign> (for<lb/>
                    <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Mars Quirinus</foreign> is not armed or marching) is usually described<lb/>

                    is Four Inches and an half broad on each side, in which are<lb/>
                    11 circular equidistant Rows of Brass Studs of that Size, that<lb/>

                    proportionably in the lesser Circles to the Center of these 11<lb/>
                    Rows of Brazen Studs, the inmost Circle is placed upon the<pb n="207"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(207)</fw><lb/>
                    <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Umbo</foreign> it self, the next 8 upon as many circular Plates of Iron,<lb/>
                    each a third of an Inch broad. The two outermost upon one<lb/>
                    thicker Plate and Inch broad: in the little Intervals between<lb/>
                    these circular Plates are plainly discovered certain cross <hi rend="italic">Lami<lb break="no"/>
                    næ</hi>, that pass on the Back of the other, from the <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Umbo</foreign> to the<lb/>
                    exterior Circle; and these Iron Plates are also about the third<lb/>
                    part of an Inch at the broader End towards the Circumference,<lb/>
                    but gradually contracted into a narrower Breadth, that they<lb/>
                    may be brought into the Compass of the <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Umbo</foreign> at the Center.<lb/>
                    The inner Coat next to those Iron Plates (for I cut it a little<lb/>
                    open behind, that I might more distinctly discern the Work)<lb/>
                    is made of very thick hard strong Leather, which cuts bright,<lb/>
                    somewhat like Parchment. Upon that is a second Cover of<lb/>
                    the same, and on the outside of this are plaited the Iron Pins<lb/>
                    that run through the Brass Studs; for the above-mentioned<lb/>
                    Brass Studs are cast purely for Ornament upon the Heads of<lb/>
                    the said Iron Pins the sixth part of an Inch long, that none<lb/>
                    of the Iron appears: this reminds me of <name type="person" rend="italic">Julius Cesar</name>'s Policy,<lb/>
                    who, as <name type="person" rend="italic">Suetonius</name> tells us, countenanced this piece of Pride or<lb/>

                    (which pass through the circular and cross Iron Plates, and<lb/>
                    both the Leather Covers) is a pure linnen Cloth, but disco<lb break="no"/>
                    loured, though perhaps not with Age only, but sower Wine<lb/>
                    and Salt, or some other Liquid wherein it seems to have been<lb/>
                    steeped. And lastly, upon the said Linnen is the outmost<lb/>
                    Cover, which is of softer Leather, all which Coats that com<lb break="no"/>
                    pose the Sheild, are bound together by two circular Plates of<lb/>
                    Iron, a thin and narrow one towards the Center, and a thick<lb break="no"/>
                    er and large one, an Inch broad at the Circumference, which<lb/>
                    is curiously nailed with two rows of very small Tackets, above<lb/>
                    400 in Number, the vacant Holes whence some of the Nails<lb/>
                    are dropt out, are little bigger than to admit the Point of a<lb/>
                    Pair of small Compasses, both which Rims do likewise fasten<lb/>
                    the Handle (the only part of Wood) which has also Six other<lb/>
                    Iron Plates about three or four Inches long, to secure it.</p>
                    
                    <p>That Sheild which I lately procured, differs not so much in<lb/>
                    Size (though it is compleatly a Foot larger in the Circumfe<lb break="no"/>
                    rence) as in the Form, for whereas this already described is al<lb break="no"/>
                    most flat, except the swelling <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Umbo</foreign>, this is absolutely <hi rend="italic">Concave</hi>,
          <pb n="208"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(208)</fw><lb/>
                    and from the Skirts of the protuberant Boss in the middle, it<lb/>
                    rises gradually to the Circumference, which is nigh three in<lb break="no"/>
                    ches perpendicular from the Center; this has Fourteen Rows<lb/>
                    of the like Brass Studs, but the circular Plates of Iron they are<lb/>
                    fixed in, do not lie upon other cross Plates, as the former does,<lb/>
                    but each from the Center, upon the outer Edge of the other,<lb/>
                    which occasions its rising in that Concave manner.</p>

                    because that, though all in general had Sheilds, yet those of<lb/>

             <p><name type="person">Dr. <hi rend="italic">Home</hi></name>, in a Letter to me in <hi rend="italic">November</hi> last, tells
              
             <lb/>me, ‘That he never us’d this Medicine to any that he 
             <lb/>knew to be troubled with a Confirm’d stone (being 
             <lb/>perswaded that 
             no Medicine can break a large stone) 
             <lb/>but only to such as were afflicted with Gravel or small 
             <lb/>Stones; that some of his 
             Patients were cured without 
             <lb/>evacuating any gravel or Stones at all, that others eva<lb break="no"/>cuated both: That it never 
             does its Work suddenly, 
             <lb/>(being not remarkably Diuretick) but that it rather 
             <lb/>dissolved the little Stones than forced ‘em. That none
              
             <lb/>that he ever gave this Medicine to, however grievously 
             <lb/>and frequently afflicted before, have ever been troubled 
             <lb/>
             with Nephritick pains since; That his manner of giving 
             <lb/>it, is in fine pouder mixed with about a third part of <hi rend="italic">flores
                  
             <lb/>Chamomel:</hi> Dose from half a Dram to one Dram in 
             <lb/>White-wine. That the greatest Dose is often apt to 
             <lb/>offend and nauseate 
             the Stomach; That he once gave 
             <lb/>it alone with a weak infusion of Chamomil Flow<lb break="no"/>ers, in White-wine after it, but that 
             this did not so 
             <lb/>well.</p>
              
             <p>Thus far he. I can say but little yet of my own 
             <lb/>Knowledge of this Medicine, having had it but a short 
             <lb/>while, and not us’d it 
             yet to any but one Gentlewoman, 
             <lb/>whose frequent and violent Fits of the Gravel, made her 
             <lb/>lead a Life uneasy enough. I gave her 
             this Medicine 
             <lb/>not mixed with <hi rend="italic">flores Chamomel</hi> (for at that time I was 
             <lb/>unacquainted with <name type="person">Dr. 
              <hi rend="italic">Home</hi></name><hi rend="italic">s</hi> manner of giving it) but 
             <lb/>with poudered <hi rend="italic">Semina Saxifrag
              </hi>. I cannot say, that since 
             <lb/>she used this Medicine she never had any Returns of her 
             <lb/>pains, but she neither has them so violent, 
             nor so fre<lb break="no"/>quently; and whenever she is threatned with them, she 
             <lb/>most certainly finds ease by that time she has taken three
              
             <lb/>Doses of her Powder: And she has since the use of 
             <lb/>this Medicine voided a great many small Stones: But 
             <lb/>the reason perhaps why she 
             is still threatned with the<pb n="83"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(83)</fw> 
             <lb/>Return of her Nephritick Pains, is, that she has never 
             <lb/>follow’d her Medicine Throughly, but upon the third 
             <lb/>Dose, finding such certain Ease, she gives it over, till a 
             <lb/>new Fit forced her to use it again. But however, this ha<lb break="no"/>ving done so much more for her 
             already, than any 
                 <lb/>thing she ever met with before, she is so pleas’d with it 
             <lb/>and speaks such great things of it, that I believe she 
             will 
             <lb/>soon furnish me with opportunities enough of giving it 
             <lb/>a fair and full Trya;; and when I know more of it, 
             <lb/>you may expect to 
             hear further. In the mean time it 
             <lb/>may not perhaps be amiss for you to be using it your 
             <lb/>self; and I dare promise you, that you’ll find 
             some<lb break="no"/>what in it, that will make you set a Value upon 
             <lb/>it.</p>
              
             <p>I take this Shell to be that which you call <hi rend="italic">Ostracites 
             <lb/>maximus rugosus &amp; asper</hi>; and which you have with
              
             <lb/>the utmost exactness described. It burns to a Lime as 
             <lb/>other Shells do, and as the <hi rend="italic">Selenites</hi> (tho’ weakly) does.
              
             <lb/>It yields no Volatil Salt, tho’ I try’d it in a naked Fire; 
             <lb/>nor does common Oyster-shells, fresh taken and used, 
             <lb/>afford above half 
             a Scruple of a Liquor somewhat mo<lb break="no"/>derately Urinous, from four Ounces of Shells. And it 
             <lb/>may be, if they were long dryed and 
             exposed to the 
             <lb/>Weather, they would loose even that, and yield no 
             <lb/>more Volatil Salt than the <hi rend="italic">Ostracites</hi>. I confess 
             I was 
             <lb/>somewhat surprized at this matter; since there are who 
             <lb/>say, that even the other Shells, that are commonly 
             <lb/>call’d petrify’d, 
             yield a Volatil Salt: and I had my self 
             <lb/>from the Shells of Crustaceous Fishes, (particularly of 
             <lb/>Lobsters) had a Volatil Salt and fetid 
             Oyl in no incon<lb break="no"/>siderable quantity, even in a Sand Furnace. But these 
             <lb/>sort of Shells differ from other Shells (as you have ex
             <lb break="no"/>actly observed) in this too, <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Quod in his umbo ad cardi<lb break="no"/>nem leviter 
              rostratus est, qui tamen in Ostreis paulùm ali<lb break="no"/>ter est</foreign>. They differ too in their specifick Gravity,
      <pb n="84"/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center">(84)</fw> 
             <lb/>
             These being more ponderous than common Oyster-shells, 
             <lb/>and somewhat near the specifick Gravity of the <hi rend="italic">Selenites</hi>.
              
             <lb/>But indeed they differ one from another in Gravity, as 
             <lb/>well as from other Shells, as they partake more or less 
             <lb/>of a Tophaceous 
             Substance that coats many of ‘em 
             <lb/>on the inside, and which perhaps may be somewhat 
             <lb/>akin to the <hi rend="italic">Selenites</hi>. 
             And whether they may not have 
             <lb/>many other very different qualifications one from ano<lb break="no"/>ther, according to the several different 
             Beds they are 
             <lb/>found in, I think there may be some reason to doubt.  
             <lb/>I have observed some such differences among the <hi rend="italic">Cornua 
             <lb/>Ammonis</hi>, having had one or two small ones from our 
             <lb/>Coal pits here, that had a considerable mixture of the  
             <lb/>Pyrites; whereas these that are found about <name type="place" rend="italic">Whitby</name>, 
                 ap<lb break="no"/>proach, I think, more to the nature of 
             the Alum-<lb/>stone; and perhaps the <hi rend="italic">Cornua Ammonis</hi> of the Ancients 
             <lb/>were found in Beds of somewhat yet more valuable; 
             <lb/>since <name type="person" rend="italic">Pliny</name> says they were of a Golden Colour, and were  
             <lb/>reckoned, <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">inter Sacratissimas Æthiopiæ
                 gemmas</foreign>. I know  
             <lb/><name type="person" rend="italic">
              Agricola</name>, [<bibl><hi rend="italic">De ortu &amp; causis Subterraneorum</hi>, lib.iv.</bibl>] ac<lb break="no"/>counts for this Golden 
             Colour after another manner: 
             <lb/><foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Cornua Ammonis inquit succo aluminis infecta aurei coloris 
             <lb/>fiunt
             </foreign>. And I am ready enough to think, that there is some 
             <lb/>truth not only in this Observation, but in what he imme<lb break="no"/>
             diately adds, <foreign xml:lang="la" rend="italic">Idem inquit &amp; aliis quibusdam lapidibus acci<lb break="no"/>dit</foreign>. 
                 For I cannot 
             but attribute the extraordinary appea<lb break="no"/>rance of Colours in the <hi rend="italic">Peacock-tail Coal</hi>, to its being                   
             <lb/>infected with the <hi rend="italic">Succus Aluminis</hi>, having seen some pie<lb break="no"/>ces 
                 of this pretty sort of Coal, shoot into true and ge
             <lb break="no"/>nuine Alum. Yet I cannot take this to be all the rea<lb break="no"/>son of the Golden Colour of the <hi rend="italic">Cornua 
              Ammonis</hi> of the 
             <lb/>Antients, since I think, if this had been all, they had 
             <lb/>never been numbred, or deserved a place among their

             <p>But be that matter as it will, I think its time to put 
             <lb/>an end to a Letter, that’s already grown much longer 
             <lb/>then was design’d; I shall therefore add no more con<lb break="no"/>cerning 
                 these Shells, being unwilling to burn my Fin<lb break="no"/>gers with that intricate 
             and perplext question, <hi rend="italic">What they 
             <lb/>are?</hi> All that I shall say of this matter shall be only 
             <lb/>this; If they be real
