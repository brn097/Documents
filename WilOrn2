                    <title type="book">The ornithology of Francis Willughby...: in three books:
                        wherein all the birds hitherto known ... are accurately described: the
                        descriptions illustrated by most elegant figures, nearly resembling the live
                        birds, engraven in LXXVIII copper plates: translated into English, and
                        enlarged with many additions throughout the whole work. To which are added,
                        three considerable discourses, I. Of the art of fowling: with a description
                        of several nets in two large copper plates. II. Of the ordering of singing
                        birds. III. Of falconry. By John Ray</title>

            <div type="preface">
                <head>The Preface</head>
                <p><gap reason="excerpt" resp="editorial"><desc rend="center">. . .</desc></gap></p>
                <p>Now because elegant and accurate Figures do much illustrate and facilitate the
                    understanding of Descriptions, in order to the Engraving such Figures for this
                    Work, Mr. <name type="person" ref="6" rend="italic"><persName key="Francis Willughby">Willughby</persName></name> made a Collection of as many Pictures
                    drawn in colours by the life as he could procure. First, He purchased of one <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="4126">Leonard Baltner</name>,</hi> a Fisherman of <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="221">Strasburgh</name>,</hi> a Volume containing the Pictures of all the Water-fowl
                    frequenting the <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="1031">Rhene</name></hi> near that City, as also all the
                    Fish and Water-Insects found there, drawn with great curiosity and exactness by
                    an excellent hand. The which Fowl, Fishes, and Insects the said <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="4126">Baltner</name></hi> had himself taken, described, and at his own
                    proper costs and charges caused to be drawn. Which curiosity is much to be
                    admired and commended in a Person of his Condition and Education. For my part, I
                    must needs acknowledge that I have received much light and information from the
                    Work of this poor man, and have been thereby inabled to clear many difficulties,
                    and rectifie some mistakes in <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="1906">Gesner</name>.</hi> Secondly, At <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="192">Nurenberg</name></hi> in <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="63">Germany</name></hi> he bought a
                    large Volume of Pictures of Birds drawn in colours. Third­ly, He caused
                    divers Species, as well seen in <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="22">England</name></hi> as beyond the
                    Seas, to be drawn by good Artists. Besides what he left, the deservedly
                    famous Sir <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="51">Thomas Brown</name>,</hi> Professor of Physick in
                    the City of <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="286">Norwich</name>,</hi> frankly communicated the Draughts of
                    several rare Birds, with some brief notes and descriptions of them. Out of
                    these, and the Printed Figures of <name type="person" ref="122" rend="italic">Aldrovandus,</name> and <name type="person" rend="italic" ref="4127">Pet. Olina</name>, an Italian Author, we culled out those we
                    thought most natural, and resembling the life, for the Gravers to imitate,
                    adding also all but one or two of <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="975">Marggravius</name>'s,</hi> and some
                    out of <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="128">Clusius</name></hi> his Exotics, <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="153">Piso</name></hi>
                    his Natural History of the <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="101">West Indies</name>,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="151">Bontius</name></hi> his of the <hi rend="italic">East.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Gravers we employed, though they were very good Workmen, yet in many Sculps
                    they have not satisfied me. For I being at a great di­stance from <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="52">London</name>,</hi> and all advices and directions necessarily
                    passing by Letter, sometimes through haste mistook in my directions, sometimes
                    through weariness and impatience of long Writing sent not so clear and full
                    instructions as was requisite; and they as often neglected their instructions,
                    or mistook my meaning. Notwithstanding the Figures, such as they are, take them
                    all together, they are the best and truest, that is, most like the live Birds,
                    of any hitherto engraven in Brass.</p>
                <p>It is requisite now that we inform the Reader what compendious ways we sought to
                    avoid unnecessary expences in graving of Figures. 1. Of the same Species of Bird
                    when more Figures than one occurred either in divers Authors, or our own Papers,
                    or both, we caused only one, which we judged to be the best to be engraven. 2.
                    We have for the most part contented our selves with the figure of one Sex only,
                    and that the Male. 3. We have omitted all such dubious <hi rend="italic">Icons</hi> as we knew not whether they were of true birds or not, or could
                    not certainly determine of what <hi rend="italic">Species</hi> they were. 4. Of
                    such as differ only in bigness, or if otherwise in such accidents as cannot be
                    expressed in Sculpture, we have given only the Figure of the greater. Of this
                    kind are the greater and lesser <hi rend="italic">Curlew,</hi> the common <hi rend="italic">Snipe,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jack-Snipe,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Judcock.</hi> And yet some Birds we have caused to be graven
                    twice when the first time the Gravers mist their aim, and shot too wide of their
                    mark: Such are the <hi rend="italic">red-leg'd Partridge,</hi> The common <hi rend="italic">Swallow,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Swift,</hi> the common <hi rend="italic">Blackbird,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">House-Dove,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Royston Crow,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Witwall,</hi> and the
                        <hi rend="italic">Dottrel.</hi> I might add hereto the <name type="place" ref="9" rend="italic">Canada Goose</name> in the seventieth Plate, for I now persuade my self that
                    the Bird graven in Plate 71. is the same with it. The lain <hi rend="italic">Sheldrake</hi> was through mistake twice figured in Plates 70. and 71. so
                    was the <hi rend="italic">Auk</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Rozor-bill</hi> in
                    Plates 64. and 65. The figures of the <hi rend="italic">Rock Ouzel,
                        Bittern,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Stone-Curlew</hi> first graven, though
                    they were passable enough, yet having afterwards gotten very exact Figures of
                    those Birds, we caused them also to be Engraven. </p>
                <p>The whole Work we have divided into three Books. In the first we treat of <hi rend="italic">Birds</hi> in general; in the second of <hi rend="italic">Land-fowl;</hi> in the third of <hi rend="italic">Water-Fowl.</hi> The
                    second Book we have divided into two parts: The first whereof contains Birds of
                        <hi rend="italic">crooked</hi> Beak and Talons; The second, such whose Bills
                    and Claws are more <hi rend="italic">streight.</hi> The third Book is
                    tripartite: The first part takes in all Birds that <hi rend="italic">wade</hi>
                    in the waters, or frequent watery places, but swim not; The second, such as are
                    of a <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> nature between swimmers and waders, or rather
                    that partake of both kinds, some whereof are cloven-footed, and yet swim; others
                    whole-footed, but yet very long-leg'd like the waders: The third is of
                    whole-footed, or fin-toed Birds, that <hi rend="italic">swim</hi> in the
                    water.</p>
                <p>As for fabulous Birds, such as are confessedly so, <hi rend="italic">viz.
                        Phenixes, Griffins, Harpyes, Ruk,</hi> and the like, I have omitted them, as
                    being no part of our sub­ject, and all that can be said of them having
                    been more than once written already. I have also omitted some that I only
                    suspected for fictitious, as the <hi rend="italic">Scythian Bird,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Aquila Heteropus,</hi> &amp;c. Yet because I would not rely
                    too much upon my own judgment, I have put in the <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi>
                    the descriptions of some of that nature out of <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="152">Hernandez</name>,</hi>
                    which I refer to the Readers censure.</p>
                <p>It remains that I make a grateful mention of such of our learned and
                    wor­thy Friends, as have given us any considerable information or
                    assistance; as well to do them right, as to acquaint the Reader whom we mean by
                    some names recorded in this Work. Those were Sir <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="51">Thomas

                                    where they end are terminated in a circle. The Breast, and all
                                    the lower Belly elegantly cloathed with yellow feathers mingled
                                    with pavonine. Cross the Breast from the one side to the other
                                    is a broad line drawn, of a sanguine colour. The whole Back,
                                    Wings, Tail, and upper Legs are covered with dark green
                                    feathers, [or black with a gloss of green] like the colour usual
                                    in our <hi rend="italic">Magpies.</hi> The end of the Back above
                                    the beginning of the Tail is of a sanguine colour to more than
                                    the Circumfe­rence of a Crown piece. The Wings end at the
                                    rise of the Tail, and within side are of a dark ash-colour. The
                                    Bill is black within. This Bird doth, as it were,
                                    pro­nounce its own name, crying with a sharp voice, but
                                    not very shril, <hi rend="italic">Aracari.</hi>

                                <p>This Bird is very like the <hi rend="italic">Toucan</hi> or <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="96">Brasilian</name> Pie.</hi> The conformation of its
                                    Feet argues it to belong to the Woodpecker-kind. We saw the Bill
                                    of this Bird in the <hi rend="italic">Re­pository</hi> of

                                    also have one of them: It is much less than the <hi rend="italic">Toucans</hi> Bill, not so compressed
                                    side-ways, but rounder. The upper Chap wholly white, without any
                                    line of black in the top, (wherein it differs from the <hi rend="italic">Ara­cari</hi>'s

                                    far different shape: For its Head was great, covered as it were
                                    with a certain membrane resembling a hood: Beside, its Bill was
                                    not flat and broad, but thick and long; of a yellowish colour
                                    next the Head, the point being black: The upper Chap was hooked;
                                    in the nether had a bluish spot in the middle between the yellow
                                    and black part. They reported that it is covered with thin and
                                    short feathers, and wants Wings, instead whereof it hath only
                                    four or five long, black feathers; that the hinder part of the
                                    body is yery fat and fleshy, wherein for the Tail were four or
                                    five small curled feathers, twirled up together, of an
                                    ash-colour. Its Legs are thick ra­ther than long, whose
                                    upper part, as far as the knee, is covered with black feathers;
                                    the lower part, together with the Feet, of a yellowish colour:
                                    Its Feet divided into four toes, three (and those the longer)
                                    standing forward, the fourth and shortest backward; all
                                    furnished with black Claws. After I had composed and writ down

                                    his Island. It was not very long, from the
                                    knee to the bending of the foot being but little more than four
                                    inches; but of a great thickness, so that it was almost four
                                    inches in compass, and covered with thick-set scales, on the
                                    upper side broader, and of a yel­lowish colour, on the
                                    under [or backside of the Leg] lesser and dusky. The upper side
                                    of the Toes was also covered with broad scales, the under side
                                    wholly callous. The Toes were short for so thick a Leg: For the
                                    length of the greatest or middlemost Toe to the nail did not
                                    much exceed two inches, that of the other Toe next to it scarce
                                    came up to two inches: The back-toe fell something short of an
                                    inch and half: But the Claws of all were thick, hard, black,
                                    less than an inch long; but that of the back-toe longer than the
                                    rest, exceeding an inch. The Mariners in their dialect gave this
                                    bird the name of <hi rend="italic">Walghvogel,</hi> that is, a
                                    nauseous, or yellowish bird: Partly because after long boyling
                                    its fleshbecame not tender, but continued hard, and of a
                                    difficult concoction; excepting the Breast and Gizzard, which
                                    they found to be of no bad relish; partly because they could
                                    easily get many <hi rend="italic">Turtle-Doves,</hi> which were
                                    much more delicate and pleasant to the Palate. Wherefore it was
                                    no wonder that in comparison of those they despised this, and
                                    said they could well be content to be without it. Moreover they
                                    said, that they found certain stones in its Gizzard: <hi rend="italic">And no wonder, for all other birds as well as

                                    and a <hi rend="italic">Turkey,</hi> from which it partly
                                    differs in shape, and partly agrees with them, especially with
                                    the <hi rend="italic">African Ostriches,</hi> if you consider
                                    the Rump, quils, and feathers: So that it shews like a Pigmy
                                    among them, if you regard the shortness of its Legs. It hath a
                                    great, ill-favoured Head, covered with a kind of membrane
                                    resembling a hood: Great, black Eyes, a bending, prominent, fat
                                    Neck: An extraordinary long, strong, bluish white Bill, only the
                                    ends of each Mandible are of a different colour, that of the
                                    upper black, that of the nether yellowish, both sharp-pointed
                                    and crooked. It gapes huge wide, as being naturally very
                                    voracious. Its body is fat, round, co­vered with soft,
                                    grey feathers, after the manner of an <hi rend="italic">Ostriches:</hi> In each side instead of hard Wing-feathers
                                    or quils, it is furnished with small soft-feathered Wings, of a
                                    yellowish ash-colour; and behind the Rump, instead of a Tail, is
                                    adorned with five small curled feathers of the same colour. It
                                    hath yellow Legs, thick, but very short; four Toes in each foot,
                                    solid, long, as it were scaly, armed with strong, black Claws.
                                    It is a slow-paced and stupid bird, and which easily becomes a
                                    prey to the Fowlers. The flesh, especially of the Breast, is
                                    fat, esculent, and so copious, that three or four <hi rend="italic">Dodos</hi> will sometimes suffice to fill an
                                    hundred Seamens bellies. If they be old, or not well boyled,
                                    they are of difficult concoction, and are salted and stored up
                                    for provision of victual. There are found in their stomachs
                                    stones of an ash-colour of di­vers figures and
                                    magnitudes; yet not bred there as the common people and Seamen

                                    rather crookedness, of its Bill it differs much from them. Those

                                    bring the birds themselves alive in Cages, therefore they flay
                                    off the skins of such as are more beautiful than the rest, as
                                    this is, and bringing them over make a great gain of the sale of
                                    them; especi­ally of this which they call, the <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="96">Brasilian</name> Blackbird;</hi> though in bigness it

                                    other rednesses. The Tail is long; the Feet and Legs black; The
                                    Bill short, as in a <hi rend="italic">Sparrow.</hi> The feathers
                                    are red to the very bottom. That which <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="122"><persName key="Aldrovandi" ref="122">Aldrovandus</persName></name></hi> describes, perchance from a picture, was
                                    in some things different from <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="124">Bellonius</name></hi>

                                    all the upper feathers by the shoulders of a deep red. Next to
                                    them are some black ones, then red ones again; the subsequent,

                                    black, as is also the Tail. The Bill also is not so short as in

                                    crooked, without of a dusky colour, within yellow, as I
                                    conjecture from the colour of the corners of the mouth <hi rend="italic">[rictûs.]</hi> Moreover, the Feet are not

                                    for the proportion of the Legs: The Claws short, but crooked, of

                                    by the dried skin. The colour of the whole upper side was black;
                                    only the edges of the feathers about the Rump were ash-coloured.
                                    The Breast was of a scarlet colour: The Bill like a <hi rend="italic">Blackbirds:</hi> The Tail also long, and like

                                    of a <hi rend="italic">Lark.</hi> It hath (saith he) a long

                                    the four toes: A Bill a little crooked and black, half an inch
                                    long. The whole body is cove­red with shining black
                                    feathers; yet under the Throat spots of a Vermilion colour are
                                    mingled with the black. This bird differs from ours in its
                                    smalness, and the shortness of its Bill.</p>

                                    History, sent me a Picture of one of these birds taken on the

                                    a short description of it, as follows. It was about a yard high:
                                    It had  <note type="orig">* Of a red
                                            <lb/>lead colour.</note> *red Bill and Legs; the Claws
                                    of the Feet like hu­mane Nails. The lower parts of both
                                    Wings were black, so that when the Wings were closed or gathered
                                    up, the lower part of the Back appeared black. Yet the Tail,
                                    which was wholly covered and hid by the Wings (as being scarce
                                    an inch long) was white, as was also the upper part of the Body.
                                    The quills were equal in bigness to <hi rend="italic">Swans</hi>
                                    quills. It made a snapping or clattering noise with its Bill, by
                                    the quick and frequent striking one Chap against the other. It
                                    readily eat Frogs and Land-snails which we offered it; but
                                    refused Toads. It is but rarely seen on our Coasts. So far Sir

                                weight is eighteen ounces: Its length from Bill to Tail eighteen
                                inches, to the points of the Claws twenty: Its breadth from tip to
                                tip of the Wings extended thirty six inches. The length of the Bill,
                                measuring from the tip to the angles of the mouth, two inches. The
                                Bill is not much unlike a <hi rend="italic">Gulls,</hi> but
                                streight, sharp-pointed, black as far as the Nosthrils, then yellow.
                                The <hi rend="italic">Irides</hi> of the Eyes and edges of the
                                Eye-lids are yellow. Under the Eyes is a bare space of a yellowish
                                green colour. The Legs are long and yellow. The Claws small and
                                black.It hath only three fore-toes, wanting the back-toe. The
                                outmost Toe a little longer than the mid­dlemost; All joyned
                                together by a certain membrane, which on the inside the middle toe
                                begins at the second joynt, on the outside at the first, and reaches
                                almost to the Claws of the outer Toes. The Legs (as <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="124">Bellonius</name></hi> observes) are very thick below the
                                Knees, as if they were swoln, by reason of the bones, which are
                                there great; wherefore that he might render the Bird more easie to
                                be known, he named it, <hi rend="italic">Oedic­nemus.</hi>
                                The upper Legs are above half way bare of feathers; which note
                                alone, were there no other, argues this Bird to be a Water-fowl. The
                                Chin, Breast, and Thighs are white: The Throat, Neck, Back, and Head
                                covered with feathers, ha­ving their middle parts black,
                                their lateral or borders of a reddish ash-colour, like that of a <hi rend="italic">Curlew:</hi> 
                                Whence they of <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="59">Norfolk</name></hi> 
                                call it, The <hi rend="italic">Stone-Curlew.</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>In each Wing are about twenty nine quil-feathers; the first and
                                second of which have a transverse white spot, else their exteriour
                                surface black: The four next to these black: The three following
                                have their bottoms and tips white: Then succeed thir­teen
                                black ones; the last or next to the body are of the same colour with
                                it. The first feathers of the second row are black: The rest have
                                white tips, and under the tips a cross line or border of black. In
                                the lesser rows of Wing-feathers is a transverse bed or bar of
                                white. The coverts of the under-side of the Wings, especially those
                                springing from the shoulders, are purely white. The outmost feathers
                                of the Tail for the space of an inch are black, then white: The next
                                to these, one on each side, are variegated, with one or two brown
                                bars crossing the white part: The rest, the white by degrees fading
                                and disappearing, become of the same colour with the body. The tips
                                of the middlemost are a little black. The Tail is five inches long,
                                consisting of twelve feathers. The guts great: The blind guts three
                                inches long: The single um­bilical blind gut half an inch. We
                                bought this bird in the Market at <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="70">Rome</name>,</hi> and

                                foolish and stupid bird. Being shut up in any room, it walks up and
                                down, sometimes in a round about a Pillar or any other thing for a
                                long time, and if any block or impediment be in its way it will
                                rather leap over it, than decline from the right way.  <note type="orig">* It winks <lb/>not.

                                to them. It is ea­sily made tame, for when it is at liberty
                                in the fields it is not much afraid of a man. It is a Water-fowl,
                                and lives in fenny Meadows, or about Marshes. In houses also it
                                catches Mice in the night time. I hear that it abounds in the <name type="place" rend="italic">Low Countries</name>, that it wanders up and down in
                                the night, and makes a noise like a Whistle, or Pipe.</p>

                                long-bodied, and hath but an indifferent Head. The Cocks and Hens
                                differ not in colours. Its Bill is streight, black, an inch long,
                                from a thick base lessening by degrees into a sharp point, something
                                flat, stronger and stiffer than in the <hi rend="italic">Woodcock</hi> kind.</p>
                            <p>The colour of the Plumage in the Head, Neck, Shoulders, Wings, and
                                upper part of the Breast is brown. [Mr. <name type="person" ref="6">Willughby</name> makes the feathers covering these parts to be
                                black, or purplish black in the middle, cinereous, or of a white
                                russet about the edges.] All the under-side, but the Breast, is as
                                white as snow. The Plumage on the middle of the Back is white; but
                                on the very Rump is a great, transverse, black spot. The long
                                scapular feathers are brown, with edges of an ash-colour, or dirty
                                white. The quil-feathers of the Wings are about twenty six, of a
                                brown or dusky colour: But from the outmost three or four their
                                bottoms are white, continually more and more, till in the nineteenth
                                and twentieth the white spreads almost over the whole feather. In
                                the second row the foremost feathers are wholly black: The tips of
                                the following being white, together make a broad line of white cross
                                the Wing. The edges of the lesser rows are red. Near the second
                                joynt of the Wing is a white spot. The Tail is two inches and an
                                half long, consisting of twelve feathers, of which the lower half is
                                white, the upper black, yet the very tips white.</p>
                            <p>The Legs are short, of a Saffron or Orange colour. The Claws black:

                                toe coupled by a mem­brane as far as the first joynt. It hath

                                very small, and seem to be altogether unsit for flight. Its Bill is
                                like the <hi rend="italic">Auks,</hi> but longer and broader,
                                compressed sideways, graven in with seven or eight furrows in the
                                upper mandible, with ten in the lower. The lower Mandible also
                                bunches out into an angle downward, like a <hi rend="italic">Gulls</hi> Bill. It differs from the <hi rend="italic">Auks</hi> Bill in that it hath no white lines. From the Bill to
                                the Eyes on each side is extended a line or spot of white. It wants
                                the back-toe, and hath a very short tail.</p>

                            <p>The Birds of this kind, found in the Islands of the strait of
                                <name type="place" ref="1048">Magellane</name>, the <hi rend="italic">Hol­landers</hi> from their fatness called <hi rend="italic">Penguins</hi>. [I
                                find in <name type="person">Mr. <hi rend="italic">Terries</hi></name> Voyage to the <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="136">East Indies</name></hi> mention made of this
                                Bird. He describes it to be a great lazy bird, with a white Head,
                                and coal-black body. Now seeing <hi rend="italic">Penguin</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Welsh</hi> Tongue
                                signi­fies a <hi rend="italic">white head</hi>, I rather think the Bird was so called from
                                its white head; though I confess that our Penguin hath not a white
                                Head, but only some white about the Eyes.] This (saith <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="128">Clusius</name></hi>) is a
                                Sea-fowl of the <hi rend="italic">Goose</hi>-kind, though unlike in its Bill. It lives in
                                the Sea; is very fat, and of the bigness of a large Goose, for the
                                old ones in this kind are found to weigh thirteen, fourteen, yea,
                                sometimes sixteen pounds; the younger eight, ten, and twelve. The
                                upper side of the body is covered with black feathers, the under
                                side with white. The Neck (which in some is short and thick) hath as
                                it were a ring or collar of white feathers. Their skin is thick like
                                a <hi rend="italic">Swines</hi>. They want Wings, but instead thereof they have two small
                                skinny sins, hanging down by their sides like two little arms,
                                covered on the upper side with short, narrow, stiff feathers,
                                thick-set; on the under side with lesser and stiffer, and those
                                white, wherewith in some places there are black ones intermixt;
                                altogether unfit for flight, but such as by their help the birds
                                swim swiftly. I understood that they abide for the most part in the
                                water, and go to land only in breeding time, and for the most part
                                lie three or four in one hole. They have a Bill bigger than a
                                <hi rend="italic">Ra­vens</hi>, but not so  <note type="orig">* Elated.</note>  *high; and a very short
                                Tail; black, flat Feet, of the form of <hi rend="italic">Geese</hi>­feet, but not so broad.
                                They walk erect, with their heads on high, their fin-like Wings
                                hanging down by their sides like arms, so that to them who see them
                                afar off they appear like so many diminutive men or <hi rend="italic">Pigmies</hi>. I find
                                in the Diaries [or Jour­nals of that Voyage] that they feed only
                                upon fish, yet is not their flesh of any un­grateful relish, nor
                                doth it taste of fish. They dig deep holes in the shore like
                                Cony­burroughs, making all the ground sometimes so hollow, that the
                                Seamen walking over it would often sink up to the knees in those
                                vaults. These perchance are those <hi rend="italic">Geese</hi>, which <hi rend="italic"><name type="person">Gomora</name></hi> saith are
                                without feathers, never come out of the Sea, and instead of feathers
                                are covered with long hair. Thus far <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="128">Clusius</name></hi>, whose description
                                agrees well enough to our <hi rend="italic">Penguin</hi>; but his figure is false in that
                                it is drawn with four toes in each foot.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="132">Olaus Wormius</name></hi>*  <note type="orig">* Musei, lib. 3. <lb/>cap. 19.</note>  treating of
                                this bird, to <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="128">Clusius</name></hi> his description adds of his own observation as
                                followeth. This Bird was brought me from the <name type="place">Ferroyer Islands</name>; I
                                kept it alive for some months at my house. It was a young one, for
                                it had not arrived to that bigness as to exceed a common <hi rend="italic">Goose</hi>. It
                                would swallow an entire <hi rend="italic">Herring</hi> at once, and sometimes three
                                successively before it was satisfied. The feathers on its back were
                                so soft and even that they resembled black Velvet. Its Belly was of
                                a pure white. Above the Eyes it had a round white spot, of the
                                bigness of a Dollar, that you would have sworn it were a pair of
                                Spectacles, (which <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="128">Clusius</name></hi> observed not) nei­ther were its Wings of
                                that figure he expresses; but a little broader, with a border of
                                white.</p>

                            <p>Whether it hath or wants the back-toe neither <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="128">Clusius</name></hi> nor <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="132">Wormius</name></hi> in
                                their de­scriptions make any mention. In <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="132">Wormius</name></hi> his figure there
                                are no back-toes drawn.</p>

                            <p>This Bird exceeding the rest of this kind in bigness justly
                                challenges the first place among them.</p>

                                Bill, about two inches long, somewhat bending downward, and
                                sharp-pointed. A line of black is drawn on each side from the corner
                                of the mouth to the back of the Head. The Belly is white: The Back
                                also is white, but variegated with transverse lines of black thick
                                set, which make it very beautiful to behold. The Wings are very
                                long, yet each single feather short, as in the <hi rend="italic">Soland-goose.</hi> In the outmost quil-feathers the one Web,

                                part of the feather along the shaft is black, the edges on both
                                sides white; the next to these are all white; those next of all to
                                the body black, and longer than the rest. The Feet are black, the
                                Legs white: All the four Toes web'd toge­ther. In the Tail
                                (if one may rely upon the stuft skin, or credit the relation of
                                those those that sent it) are only two very long feathers, of about
                                eighteen inches, narrow, and ending in snarp points. This
                                description I took from the case of the bird con­served in

                                bigger. Its colour on the Head, Neck, Back, and whole upper side is
                                dusky or black, on the Breast and Belly white. The Bill is an inch
                                and half, or it may be two inches long, narrow, black, and for its
                                figure something like to a <hi rend="italic">Lap­wings</hi>
                                Bill, the upper Chap being hooked at the end, like a <hi rend="italic">Cormorants.</hi> Its base is co­vered with
                                a naked skin, in which are the Nosthrils. From the Nosthrils on each
                                side a furrow or groove is produced almost to the hook. The Head is

                                feed their young ones wondrous fat. The old ones early in the

                                Island it self, and spend the whole day in fishing in the Sea, never

                                twilight: So that all day the Island is so quiet and still from all
                                noise as if there were not a bird about it. What­ever fish or
                                other food they have gotten and swallowed in the day-time, by the

                                whereof in the night-time they vomit up into the mouths of their

                                covered only with soft feathers, or a kind of down: Which is
                                altogether false, they being furnished with sufficiently long Wings
                                and Tail, and flying very swiftly. They say it is a foolish bird,
                                and easily taken. We are told that they breed not only on the <hi rend="italic">Calf of Man,</hi> but also on the <hi rend="italic">Silly</hi> Islands. Notwithstanding they are sold

                                histo­ry of it as followeth. The <hi rend="italic">Shear-water</hi> is a Sea-fowl, which fishermen observe to
                                resort to their Vessels in some numbers, swimming swiftly to and
                                fro, backward, forward, and about them, and doth as it were, <hi rend="italic">radere aquam,</hi> shear the water, from whence
                                perhaps it had its name. It is a fierce and snapping fowl, and very
                                untracta­ble. I kept two of them five of six weeks in my
                                house, and they refusing to feed, I caused them to be crammed with
                                fish, till my Servant grew weary, and gave them over: And they lived
                                fifteen days without any food. So far Sir <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="51">Thomas</name>.</hi> This Bird, according to the Picture of it, hath a

                                    thinner set on the Neck, and thicker on the Back. These white

                                    especially the outmost. The back-toe is very short and little.
                                    Its Legs are of a mean length, but flat and broad like the ends
                                    of Oars, the exteriour surface being brown or black: The

                                    unless erected perpendi­cularly upon the Tail. It hath no

                                    two Lobes, and hath a bladder to contain Gall: Above the stomach
                                    the Gullet is dilated into a kind of Craw, the interiour surface
                                    whereof is granulated with certain papillary glandules. The

                                    it was two foot long. The compass of the body round was more
                                    than two foot. The Wings were fourteen inches long: The Tail
                                    scarce three: The Tongue almost three: The Bill more than four:
                                    The Neck near eight, and somewhat more in compass: The Head
                                    short, three inches broad: The Legs somewhat longer than three
                                    inches: The Feet four inches wide. So far

                                    Of that which Mr. <name type="person" ref="6" rend="italic">Willughby</name> 
                                    described at <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="131">Venice</name></hi>
                                    the measures were as followeth: The weight thirty six ounces:
                                    The length from Bill to Claws thirty one inches; from Bill to
                                    Tail twenty eight. The Bill from the tip to the an­gles
                                    of the mouth was almost three inches long: The Tail two: The
                                    second bone of the Leg four and a quarter; the third two and an
                                    half; the outmost fore-toe three inches and an half. The Tongue
                                    long, sharp, having a transverse bed of asperities not far from
                                    the bottom, beneath which it is toothed on each side, as this
                                    figure re­presents. <figure><figDesc>[tiny diagram]</figDesc></figure> 
                                    In the Palate, on each
                                    side the fissure, are five rows of prickles or asperities. The
                                    blind guts were three inches and an half long. Hence it
                                    manifest­ly appears, that the bird described by 
                                    <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="128">Clusius</name></hi> was bigger than ours.
                                    But perchance <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="128">Clusius</name></hi> 
                                    his was a Cock, ours a Hen. For those I saw at Dr.

                                    were nothing at all less than
                                    that of <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="128">Clusius</name>,</hi> 
                                    sent him by <name type="person" rend="italic" ref="4136">Hoierus.</name> But what

                                    writes of them, that they cannot fly at all, is
                                    a mistake; for though they never breed in 
                                    <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="22">England</name>,</hi> 
                                    yet in hard Winters they come over hither. I
                                    scarce believe they swim so far. Whence it is manifest, that
                                    they not only flie, but make great flights.</p>

                                    but rounder-bodied. The whole body all over is of a black or
                                    sable colour. From the Shoulders in some birds spring blacker
                                    feathers. In the Chin and middle of the Breast some ash-coloured
                                    or whitish fea­thers are mingled with the black. The
                                    Wings are of the same colour with the body, without any
                                    diversity of colours at all. The Bill such as in the Duck-kind,
                                    yellow about the Nosthrils, else black; pectinated about the
                                    sides, yellow within, with­out any bunch in the upper
                                    Mandible. Its Feet are black. This description is of a Hen.</p>
                                <p>In the year <date when="1671">1671</date>. I found the Male of this kind at <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="329">Chester</name>,</hi> killed on the Sea-coasts
                                    thereabouts, and bought in the Market by my Lord Bishop <hi rend="italic"><name type="person" ref="995">Wilkins</name></hi> his <name type="person" key="Steward">Steward</name>, and described it in
                                    these words.</p>
                                <p>It is something less than a tame <hi rend="italic">Duck,</hi>
                                    short-bodied for its bigness, and broad; all over black both
                                    upper and under-side: Only the Head had a dark tincture of
                                    pur­ple, and the under-side of the first, second, and
                                    third rows of Wing-feathers inclined to cinereous. The wings
                                    were short; the quils in each twenty five. The Tail more than an
                                    hand-breadth long, consisting of sixteen feathers, the outmost
                                    of which were the shortest, the rest in order longer to the
                                    middlemost, which were the longest, so that the Tail runs out
                                    into an acute angle, more acute than I remember to have
                                    ob­served in other <hi rend="italic">Sea-ducks;</hi> and
                                    each single feather is very sharp-pointed.</p>
                                <p>The Bill in this Bird is especially remarkable, being broad,
                                    blunt, as in the rest of this kind, of about two inches length,
                                    having no <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi> or nail at the tip,
                                    contra­ry to the manner of other <hi rend="italic">Ducks.</hi> 
                                    The upper Mandible above the Nostrils, next the
                                    forehead, bunches out into a notable protuberance, being so
                                    divided in the middle as to resemble Buttocks, distinguished by
                                    a yellow intercurrent line. Now the colour of this upper
                                    Mandible is black about the sides, yellow in the middle, the
                                    yellow part being so broad as to contain the Nosthrils, and
                                    about an inch long. The Tongue is very great. The Eye-lids
                                    yellow. The <hi rend="italic">Irides</hi> of the Eyes dark. The
                                    Legs and Feet dusky: The Toes very long,and web'd together, so
                                    that its oars are broad and large. The shorter Toe hath a
                                    membranous border extant along its outside. This had no
                                    labyrinth on its Wind-pipe. The blind-guts for a bird of this
                                    kind were very short: The Gall great. It weighed two pounds and
                                    nine ounces: Its length from Bill to Tail was twenty two inches:
                                    It breadth from Wings end to Wings end thirty four and an
                                    half.</p>
                                <p>This Bird hath not as yet been described by any Author extant in
                                    Print that we know of. It abides constantly at Sea, gets
                                    itsliving by diving, and is taken in Nets placed under water. In
                                    the wash in <hi rend="italic"><name type="place" ref="390">Lincolnshire</name></hi> it is found
